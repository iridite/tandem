# Tandem Principles

1. **Local-first by default**: user data stays on-device.
2. **Zero trust**: powerful actions require explicit approval.
3. **Understandable UX**: no jargon required to be successful.
4. **Provider freedom**: use any model provider; avoid lock-in.
5. **Auditability**: users can see what happened and undo it.
