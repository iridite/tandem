# TUI Guide

The Tandem TUI provides a terminal-based interface for interacting with AI agents, managing sessions, and running tools.

## Workflows

### Setup Wizard
On your first run, Tandem will guide you through the initial configuration:
1.  **Welcome**: Introduction to the tool.
2.  **Select Provider**: Choose your AI provider (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama).
3.  **Enter API Key**: Securely input your credential (stored in the system keystore).
4.  **Select Model**: Choose the default model for your sessions.

### Request Center
Tandem prioritizes security and user control. When an agent wants to perform a sensitive action (like running a shell command or writing to a file) or needs your input, it initiates a **Request**.
-   **Permission Requests**: Approve or Deny tool usage. You can approve "Once", "Always for this session", or "Always for this project".
-   **Question Requests**: The agent may ask clarifying questions which appear here.
-   Access the Request Center via the specific keybinding (default `Alt+R`) or slash command `/requests`.

### Pin Prompt
If you have encrypted your local storage, you will be prompted to enter your **PIN** at startup to unlock your semantic memory and session history.

## Key Features
-   **Chat Interface**: Interact with agents in real-time.
-   **Session Management**: Create, switch, and rename sessions.
-   **Tool Integration**: Execute file operations, web searches, and more.
-   **Slash Commands**: Quick access to features via `/`.
