# Running Tandem

Tandem consists of two main components that work together: the **Engine** (server) and the **TUI** (client).

## 1. Start the Engine

The engine must be running for clients to connect.

```bash
# Start the engine server
tandem-engine
```

By default, the engine listens on `http://127.0.0.1:39731`. You can configure the port and other settings via environment variables (see [Configuration](./configuration.md) - _coming soon_).

## 2. Start the TUI

Open a new terminal window and start the Terminal User Interface:

```bash
mermaid
graph LR
    A[User] -- TUI --> B[tandem-tui]
    B -- HTTP --> C[tandem-engine]
```

```bash
# Start the TUI
tandem-tui
```

The TUI will attempt to connect to the local engine. If the engine is not running, the TUI will display a connection error or waiting status.

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Refused**: Ensure `tandem-engine` is running in a separate terminal.
- **Port Conflicts**: If port 39731 is in use, you may need to change the engine's port (TBD: add config instruction).
