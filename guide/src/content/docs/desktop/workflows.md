title: Desktop Workflows
---

These are the core desktop workflows teams use most.

## Chat Workflow

1. Open a session.
2. Set mode/provider/model.
3. Send a scoped prompt.
4. Review tool requests and approve intentionally.
5. Iterate until completion.

## Multi-Agent / Multi-Session Workflow

1. Create additional agents for parallel tasks.
2. Keep one session per objective.
3. Use clear session titles for retrieval.

## Routine and Mission Workflow

- Use routines for recurring tasks (interval-based execution).
- Use missions for structured multi-step outcomes with review/test gates.

## Model/Provider Switching Workflow

1. Use `/providers` and `/models` views (or desktop equivalents).
2. Change provider/model when quality, speed, or cost goals shift.
3. Retest with a short validation prompt after switching.
