title: Desktop App Overview
---

The Tandem Desktop app is the primary interface for multi-session AI workflows, with the engine running locally for fast tool execution and private workspace context.

## What Desktop Includes

- Chat-first workflow for coding and research tasks.
- Session and agent management for parallel work.
- Provider/model controls and key management.
- Approval and request center for tool safety.
- Local config and state management through the engine.

## Desktop vs TUI vs Engine

- **Desktop App**: Visual app for daily work and orchestration.
- **TUI**: Terminal-first workflow using the same backend model.
- **Engine**: Headless runtime/API that powers both interfaces.
