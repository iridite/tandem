title: Desktop Troubleshooting
---

## Engine Not Connected

- Restart the desktop app.
- Verify engine port/config.
- Check for another process already binding the engine port.

## Provider Errors

- Re-enter API key.
- Confirm provider/model is valid and available.
- Switch provider/model to isolate quota/rate issues.

## Tool Requests Stuck

- Open Request Center and resolve pending approvals/questions.
- Cancel and re-run if a request was left unanswered.

## Session Performance Issues

- Split long sessions into smaller topic-focused sessions.
- Reduce prompt/context size.
- Switch to a faster model for exploratory turns.

## Recovery

- Restart desktop and engine.
- Re-open workspace and session.
- Re-run with a small validation prompt first.
