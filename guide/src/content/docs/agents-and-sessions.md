## Agents

In Tandem, an **Agent** is a specialized persona with specific instructions, permissions, and tools.

For policy-gated multi-agent spawning and lineage tracking, see [Agent Teams](./agent-teams/).

### Built-in Agents

Tandem comes with several built-in agents:

- **`build` (Default)**: Focused on implementation. Inspects the codebase before answering.
- **`plan`**: Focused on high-level planning and scoping.
- **`explore`**: A sub-agent for gathering context and mapping the codebase.
- **`general`**: A general-purpose helper.

### Custom Agents

You can define custom agents by creating markdown files in `.tandem/agent/`.
Example: `.tandem/agent/reviewer.md`

```markdown
---
name: reviewer
mode: primary
tools: ["read", "scan"]
---

You are a code review agent. Focus on finding bugs and security issues.
```

### Agent Modes

- **Primary**: Can be selected as the main agent for a session.
- **Subagent**: Designed to be called by other agents (or used for specific sub-tasks), usually hidden from the main selection menu.

## Sessions

A **Session** is a conversation thread with an agent.

- Sessions are persisted in `storage/session/`.
- Each session maintains its own message history and context.
- You can switch agents mid-session, though it is usually better to start a new session for a different mode of work.

## The Loop

When you send a message, the **Engine Loop**:

1. Appends your message to the history.
2. Selects the active agent's system prompt.
3. Sends the context to the LLM.
4. **Tool Use**: If the LLM requests a tool (e.g., `read_file`), the Engine checks permissions, executes the tool, and feeds the output back to the LLM.
5. This repeats until the LLM produces a final text response.
