## [0.3.8]

### Added

- **Headless Web Admin UI (embedded, single-file)**: Added an embedded `/admin` web interface served directly by `tandem-server` using a baked-in `admin.html` shell (no external assets/build pipeline at runtime).
- **Realtime Admin UX**: Added SSE-driven UI refresh behavior (with polling fallback) for channel/session/memory visibility in the headless admin surface.
- **Channel Admin API surface**: Added channel-management endpoints for headless control:
  - `GET /channels/status`
  - `PUT /channels/{name}`
  - `DELETE /channels/{name}`
  - `POST /admin/reload-config`
- **Memory Admin API surface**: Added browse/delete endpoints for admin workflows:
  - `GET /memory`
  - `DELETE /memory/{id}`
- **Engine CLI web-admin flags**: Added `tandem-engine serve` flags:
  - `--web-ui`
  - `--web-ui-prefix`
- **Desktop Agent Command Center (first integration pass)**: Added an orchestrator-embedded command center UI for Agent Teams with live mission/instance status, spawn controls, and spawn-approval decision actions.
- **Agent-Team approval action endpoints**: Added explicit spawn approval decision routes:
  - `POST /agent-team/approvals/spawn/{id}/approve`
  - `POST /agent-team/approvals/spawn/{id}/deny`
- **Engine memory write/list tools**: Added `memory_store` and `memory_list` tools to `tandem-tools` so agents can persist and audit memory directly from engine tool calls.
- **Global memory opt-in support**: `memory_search` now supports `tier=global` when explicitly enabled via `allow_global=true` or `TANDEM_ENABLE_GLOBAL_MEMORY=1`.
- **Shared memory DB auto-wiring in engine**: `tandem-engine` now auto-configures `TANDEM_MEMORY_DB_PATH` to the shared Tandem `memory.sqlite` path when unset, aligning connected app/tool memory access by default.
- **Engine host runtime context contract**: Added shared `HostRuntimeContext` (`os`, `arch`, `shell_family`, `path_style`) in shared types/wire payloads and surfaced it through engine health/session/run metadata.
- **Server run-start environment observability**: `session.run.started` lifecycle events now include canonical engine environment metadata for cross-client parity.

### Changed

- **Headless config/env support**: Added config/env handling for web admin and channel settings (`TANDEM_WEB_UI`, `TANDEM_WEB_UI_PREFIX`, and channel env overlays).
- **Channel runtime wiring**: Wired channel listener lifecycle into server startup/reload flow with status publication events for admin visibility.
- **Security headers for embedded UI**: Added strict response headers/CSP for admin HTML responses.
- **Engine command docs**: Updated engine command reference to include new web-admin flags.
- **Desktop-Tauri agent-team bridge**: Added typed Tauri commands and frontend API wrappers for template/mission/instance/approval listing, spawn, and cancel/decision actions.
- **Startup navigation default**: Desktop now always opens in Chat view on startup (with a TODO for future starter/landing flow) instead of restoring Command Center directly.
- **Command Center observability layout**: Added inline run-scoped Console panel and elevated workspace file browser support in Command Center to improve live swarm debugging.
- **`memory_search` scope policy**: Reworked strict scope enforcement to allow controlled global search while preserving default isolation behavior unless global is explicitly enabled.
- **Engine memory docs/examples**: Expanded CLI and engine README docs with `memory_store`, `memory_list`, and global memory usage examples.
- **Engine prompt assembly (OS-aware)**: `tandem-core` now prepends a deterministic `[Execution Environment]` block (engine-detected OS/shell/path style) to model runs by default (`TANDEM_OS_AWARE_PROMPTS` toggle).
- **Canonical OS authority policy**: Runtime behavior now trusts engine-detected host environment as the source of truth rather than client-provided OS hints.
- **Engine health diagnostics**: `/global/health` now exposes `environment` metadata for troubleshooting and external clients.

### Fixed

- **Command Center tool-arg hardening**: `read`/`write` tool calls now validate argument shape (`JSON object` + non-empty `path`) and fail fast with structured `INVALID_TOOL_ARGS` instead of retry loops.
- **Workspace/path error taxonomy**: Replaced broad Windows `os error 3` pause messaging with clearer classification (`WORKSPACE_NOT_FOUND`, path-not-found fail-fast) so runs stop/recover deterministically.
- **Orchestrator retry-loop suppression**: Invalid tool args and path-not-found failures now fail task attempts directly instead of repeatedly re-queuing.
- **Task session workspace pinning**: Child task sessions are now pinned to the orchestrator workspace path, with preflight checks before session creation.
- **Tool timeout resilience for file ops**: Increased `read`/`write` tool timeouts to reduce premature synthetic terminal errors on larger workspaces.
- **Tool history ID collision fix**: Tool execution IDs now include session/message/part context (not just `part_id`) to prevent cross-session overwrite/correlation drift.
- **Structured stream error codes**: Stream tool/session terminal events now carry optional `error_code` metadata for clearer diagnostics in orchestrator + UI.
- **Builder prompt guardrails**: Builder-agent prompt now explicitly requires valid JSON tool args and non-empty `path` for file tools.

- **Desktop channel token persistence across restart**: Fixed a vault-unlock/startup race where channel bot tokens (Telegram/Discord/Slack) could fail to rehydrate into sidecar env before restart, causing saved channel connections to appear unconfigured after engine/app restart.
- **Model/provider routing hardening**: Chat, queue, rewind, undo, and command-center/orchestrator dispatches now require explicit provider+model instead of silently falling back.
- **Model selection persistence**: Fixed picker drift by persisting `providers_config.selected_model` from both Chat and Command Center selectors.
- **Provider runtime model override**: Provider calls now honor per-request model overrides, preventing unintended fallback execution (for example `gpt-4o-mini` when another model is selected).
- **OpenRouter attribution**: Added consistent request attribution headers so calls are identified as Tandem instead of unknown source.
- **Memory startup self-heal**: Corrupted/incompatible vector DB state is now detected, backed up, and auto-recovered to prevent repeated startup failures (`chunks iter error` / SQL logic errors).
- **Command Center task state/UI correctness**: Fixed paused/failed run status mapping and disabled launch actions while a run is already active to prevent duplicate swarm starts.
- **Autonomous swarm permission flow**: Orchestrator/Command Center sessions now auto-allow shell tool permissions in autonomous mode (no manual approve gate for each call).
- **Shell-call robustness**: Empty shell invocations now fail fast with explicit `BASH_COMMAND_MISSING` instead of hanging until watchdog timeout.
- **Windows shell compatibility**: Added Windows translation for common Unix shell calls used by agents (`ls -la`, `find ... -type f -name ...`) to PowerShell equivalents.
- **Stream watchdog noise reduction**: Suppressed false stream-degraded watchdog events while tools are actively pending.
- **Failed task recovery in Command Center**: Added per-task retry support that re-queues failed tasks, clears stale task failure state, and unblocks dependent tasks without forcing full run restart.
- **Failed task diagnostics clarity**: Failed task cards now surface richer validator/error detail so failure causes are visible in-place instead of opaque `session.error` noise.
- **Engine tool memory path mismatch**: Fixed default `memory_search`/memory tool DB resolution in headless engine runs by setting the shared memory DB path at runtime when not already provided.
- **Memory tool test coverage**: Added/updated tests to validate global-memory opt-in gates and prevent accidental unrestricted global access.
- **Cross-platform shell execution path**: Non-Windows engine shell tool execution now uses POSIX shell (`sh -lc`) instead of hardcoded PowerShell fallback.
- **Windows shell mismatch loops**: Expanded Windows shell guardrails to translate common Unix patterns, block unsafe Unix-only commands with structured guidance, and emit `os_guardrail_applied`/`guardrail_reason` metadata.
- **OS mismatch retry suppression**: Engine loop now suppresses repeated identical shell calls after path/shell mismatch signatures and steers model/tool flow toward cross-platform tools (`read`, `glob`, `grep`).
- **OS mismatch error taxonomy**: Server dispatch now classifies common path/shell mismatch failures as `OS_MISMATCH` for clearer diagnostics.

## [0.3.7] - 2026-02-18

### Changed

- **Complete Simplified Chinese overwrite**: Replaced and normalized Simplified Chinese copy across major app surfaces, including startup messaging, settings, About page, theme picker, provider cards, packs metadata, and skills guidance.
- **Localization completeness pass**: Converted remaining hardcoded English strings in key screens to i18n keys and filled missing `zh-CN` locale coverage.
- **Language UX polish**: Improved live language switching consistency and ensured parity-safe locale catalogs for `en`/`zh-CN`.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed

- **TUI stale shared-engine attach**: TUI now checks connected engine version during startup and applies stale-policy gating before attaching to an existing shared engine.
- **Default self-healing startup**: Added `TANDEM_ENGINE_STALE_POLICY` with default `auto_replace` so stale engines are replaced by a fresh managed engine automatically.
- **Port collision recovery**: When default/shared engine port is occupied by a stale process, TUI now falls back to an available local port for managed startup.
- **Runtime visibility**: `/engine status` now reports required engine version, stale policy, and connection source (`shared-attached` vs `managed-local`) to make diagnosis deterministic.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- **Agent Teams MVP in engine server**: Added mission/instance spawning foundations with shared server-side spawn policy enforcement, role edges, budget/cap controls, capability scopes, SKILL.md hashing, and structured agent-team SSE events for command-center style observability.
- **Agent Teams API/docs surface**: Added new guide docs for rollout, API/events, spawn policy, and protocol matrix updates; added crate-level READMEs for `tandem-ai` and `tandem-tui` with cargo-first usage.
- **Separate Registry Publish Workflow**: Added isolated GitHub Actions registry workflow (`publish-registries.yml`) for crates.io + npm publishing with dedicated triggers, environment gates, and dry-run support.
- **CI Publish Scripts**: Added CI-safe publish helpers for crates and npm (`scripts/publish-crates-ci.sh`, `scripts/publish-npm-ci.sh`, `scripts/publish-npm-ci.ps1`) with idempotent skip behavior for already-published versions.

### Changed

- **Publish chain hardening**: Reworked crate publish/version dependency chain so new crate releases resolve correctly in order, including updated crate versions for `tandem-memory`, `tandem-tools`, `tandem-core`, `tandem-server`, `tandem-tui`, and `tandem-ai`.
- **Release metadata bump**: Bumped app/wrapper versions to `0.3.5` across `package.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, and npm wrapper package manifests.
- **npm Wrapper Bin Layout**: Updated `@frumu/tandem` and `@frumu/tandem-tui` wrappers to ship stable JS bin launchers (`bin/*.js`) and use `bin/native/*` for downloaded binaries, improving npm/pnpm shim generation reliability.
- **npm Wrapper Postinstall**: Simplified wrapper postinstall command to `node scripts/install.js` to avoid package-manager-specific env var path issues.
- **Release Docs**: Expanded release process docs to include the new separate registry publish flow.

### Fixed

- **Windows publish-verify blocker**: Removed reliance on `--no-verify` workaround path by making `tandem-memory` publish verification resilient without dragging problematic static-CRT tokenizer/embedder linkage into default verification builds.
- **Wrapper/crate docs mismatch**: Clarified npm wrapper READMEs and added proper crate README instructions to prevent `npm install` guidance from leaking into crate-level workflows.
- **Cross-platform Wrapper Install Reliability**: Fixed Windows/pnpm failures where bin shims were not created before postinstall and where postinstall path resolution could fail in some package-manager environments.
- **TUI Sidecar Engine Freshness**: TUI now detects stale cached/bundled sidecar engine binaries and auto-refreshes them based on version comparison, preventing old sidecar versions from being reused.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed

- **TUI PIN startup flow**: Startup now correctly enters unlock mode whenever a vault key exists, preventing repeated create-PIN prompts across restarts.
- **TUI provider key onboarding**: First-run setup now opens when no provider keys exist in the unlocked keystore, so provider API key entry is no longer skipped.
- **TUI onboarding state logic**: Startup PIN detection and provider onboarding checks now use separate, correct signals (vault existence vs. configured keys).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed

- **TUI Provider Gating**: TUI startup/provider catalog handling now excludes the fallback `local` provider from configured-provider checks, preventing chat/session flow from starting without a real provider setup.
- **Provider Setup UX Consistency**: Key/setup checks now consistently use sanitized provider catalogs so `/key test` and startup gating match wizard behavior.
- **Desktop StreamHub Restart Recovery**: Sidecar `/event` subscription failures during startup/restart are now treated as transient for circuit-breaker accounting, preventing repeated `503` retries from opening the breaker and delaying recovery.
- **Desktop StreamHub Error Noise**: StreamHub now classifies common sidecar-transition subscription failures as recovering state retries instead of emitting repeated hard error telemetry/log spam.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **Engine-Native Mission Runtime**: Added mission APIs (`POST /mission`, `GET /mission`, `GET /mission/{id}`, `POST /mission/{id}/event`) backed by shared orchestrator reducer state.
- **Shared Orchestrator Crate**: Introduced `crates/tandem-orchestrator` with reusable mission models (`MissionSpec`, `MissionState`, `WorkItem`, `MissionEvent`, `MissionCommand`) and reducer interface.
- **Default Mission Gates**: Added reviewer/tester reducer transitions with rework handling and completion signaling.
- **Shared Resources Blackboard**: Added revisioned shared resource store + APIs (`GET/PUT/PATCH/DELETE /resource/{*key}`, `GET /resource?prefix=...`) and SSE stream (`GET /resource/events`).
- **Status Indexer**: Added engine-derived run status indexing into shared resources (`run/{sessionID}/status`) from session/tool events.
- **Memory Governance APIs**: Added scoped memory endpoints (`POST /memory/put`, `POST /memory/promote`, `POST /memory/search`, `GET /memory/audit`) with capability checks and partition validation.
- **Tiered Memory Promotion Pipeline**: Added scrub + audit promotion flow for `session/project/team/curated` memory tiers with explicit promotion controls.
- **Routine Scheduler + APIs**: Added routine persistence/scheduler and APIs (`POST/GET /routines`, `PATCH/DELETE /routines/{id}`, `POST /routines/{id}/run_now`, `GET /routines/{id}/history`, `GET /routines/events`).
- **Routine Policy Gates**: Added external side-effect gates emitting lifecycle events (`routine.fired`, `routine.approval_required`, `routine.blocked`) with history states.
- **Desktop + TUI Mission/Routine Parity**: Added Desktop sidecar + TUI client command parity for mission/routine observe/control workflows.
- **TUI Composer Upgrade**: Added multiline composer state with cursor navigation, delete-forward, and native paste event handling in `tandem-tui`.
- **TUI Markdown/Stream Pipeline**: Added tandem-local markdown renderer + newline-gated stream collector with reducer-level tail-flush correctness tests.
- **TUI Long-Transcript Performance Harness**: Added virtualization parity tests and ignored benchmark target for large transcript render profiling.

### Security

- **Provider Secret Drift Fix**: Re-aligned engine auth flow to prevent provider API keys from being persisted via config patch APIs.
- **Runtime Auth Source**: `PUT /auth/{provider}` now applies provider keys to runtime-only engine config state and reloads providers without writing secrets to disk.
- **Config Secret Rejection**: `PATCH /config` and `PATCH /global/config` now reject secret-bearing fields (`api_key`, `apiKey`) with `400 CONFIG_SECRET_REJECTED`.
- **Response Redaction**: Config API responses continue to redact secret fields so provider credentials are never returned in plaintext API payloads.

### Changed

- **Platform Boundary Formalization**: Moved to engine-first orchestrator ownership for durable mission/resource/routine state, with Desktop/TUI as control-center clients.
- **Release Contract Stability**: Promoted mission and routine event families to stable SDK contracts after snapshot and client-parity verification.
- **Design Control Plane**: Added/standardized architecture control docs (`docs/design/*`) with linked workboard/progress/decisions workflow (`W-###`).
- **TUI Key Sync Transport**: TUI now syncs unlocked keystore credentials to engine runtime via `/auth/{provider}` instead of writing keys through `/config`.
- **Desktop Runtime Auth Sync**: Desktop now pushes provider credentials to sidecar runtime auth after sidecar start/restart, aligning with keystore-first secret handling.
- **Config Layers**: Added an in-memory runtime config layer for ephemeral provider auth material (merged into effective config, never persisted).
- **TUI Transcript Rendering**: Replaced `tui-markdown` usage with tandem-local `pulldown-cmark` rendering and virtualized transcript line materialization.
- **TUI Render Throughput**: Added bounded per-message render cache (message fingerprint + width keyed) to reduce repeated markdown/wrap work per frame.

### Fixed

- **Spec/API Drift**: Synced docs with implemented APIs (including routine delete and memory audit routes) and cleaned stale orchestrator roadmap claims from active specs.
- **Progress Tracking Integrity**: Repaired progress log table formatting and upgraded phase tracking to continue under `W-016+` control-plane flow.
- **Plaintext Key Persistence Gap**: Fixed a regression where provider API keys could end up in Tandem config files under `%APPDATA%/tandem` when clients used config patch flows.
- **OpenRouter Auth Regression After Scrub**: Fixed post-scrub provider failures by wiring runtime auth to provider resolution instead of relying on persisted config secrets.
- **Browser CORS for Engine API**: Added CORS support to engine HTTP routes so browser-based examples using `X-Tandem-Token` work with preflight requests.
- **TUI Stream Merge Regression**: Prevented regressive success/failure snapshots from overwriting richer locally-finalized assistant stream tails.

## [0.3.0-rc.2] - 2026-02-15

- **TUI Error Recall Command**: Added `/last_error` to quickly print the most recent prompt/system failure message.
- **TUI Working Indicator**: Added active-agent working status/spinner visibility in chat footer and grid pane titles.
- **TUI Request Center**: Added pending-request modal (`Alt+R` / `/requests`) for permission approvals and interactive question replies.
- **Shared Permission Defaults**: Added centralized permission-default rule builder in `tandem-core` for desktop + TUI consistency.
- **Skills Discovery Expansion**: Added multi-root skills discovery in `tandem-skills` for project and ecosystem directories (`.tandem/skill`, `.tandem/skills`, `~/.tandem/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`, plus appdata compatibility).
- **Agent Skill Activation Controls**: Added optional `skills` field to agent frontmatter/config so end users can scope which skills are active per agent.
- **Strict `memory_search` Tool**: Added a new `memory_search` tool in `tandem-tools` with strict scope enforcement (requires `session_id` and/or `project_id`, blocks global-tier searches, validates tier/scope combinations).
- **Embedding Health API Surface**: Added shared embedding health (`status` + `reason`) in memory runtime types and manager API for UI/event consumption.

### Changed

- **Frontend history**: Added debounce to history refresh to prevent excessive re-fetching.
- **TUI key bindings**: Improved TUI key handling and help interface.
- **Scripts**: Updated benchmarking and sidecar download scripts.
- **Engine Default Port**: Standardized default engine endpoint to `127.0.0.1:39731` (away from common frontend port `3000`) with env overrides (`TANDEM_ENGINE_PORT`, `TANDEM_ENGINE_HOST`, `TANDEM_ENGINE_URL`).
- **Desktop/TUI Endpoint Alignment**: Desktop sidecar + TUI now share centralized default port configuration and honor env overrides for connection/spawn behavior.
- **Engine Testing Docs**: Updated `ENGINE_TESTING.md` examples to use `tandem-ai` crate commands and the new default engine port.

- **Keystore Key Mapping**: TUI now normalizes legacy/local keystore key names (e.g. `openrouter_key`, `*_api_key`, `opencode_*_api_key`) to canonical provider IDs before syncing to engine config.
- **Keystore -> Engine Sync**: On connect, TUI now syncs unlocked local keystore provider keys into engine provider config to keep desktop/TUI auth behavior consistent.
- **TUI Startup Order**: Startup now performs engine bootstrap check/download before allowing transition to PIN entry, keeping users on the matrix/connect screen until engine install is ready.
- **TUI Download UX**: Engine download view now shows byte-based progress (downloaded/total) with install phase text and last-error status on failures.
- **Transcript Rendering**: Chat flow renderer now wraps long lines for readable error/output text in narrow terminals.
- **Windows Dev Docs**: Expanded `ENGINE_TESTING.md` with PowerShell-safe build/copy/run commands and bash-vs-PowerShell clarity.
- **TUI Keybinds/UX**: Grid toggle moved to `Alt+G`; request center added on `Alt+R`; scroll speed increased for line/page scrolling.
- **Startup + PIN UX**: PIN prompt re-centered for fullscreen, digit-only PIN input enforced, and connecting screen now stays active until engine readiness checks complete.
- **Markdown Pipeline**: TUI transcript path now uses `tui-markdown` preprocessing for assistant markdown content.
- **Mode Tool Gating**: `skill` is now universal at mode level (not blocked by mode `allowed_tools` allowlists).
- **Skill Tool Scope Behavior**: `skill` now respects agent-level equipped skill lists when present (filtered list/load), while still being callable from all modes.
- **Memory Crate Integration**: `src-tauri` now consumes `crates/tandem-memory` directly via re-export facade and removed duplicated local memory implementation files.
- **Memory/Embedding UX Telemetry**: `memory_retrieval` stream events and memory settings now include embedding health fields (`embedding_status`, `embedding_reason`), and chat/settings UI surface those states.
- **Memory Telemetry Persistence**: Memory lifecycle events are now persisted into tool history (`memory.lookup`, `memory.store`) so session reloads can rehydrate memory badges and console entries.
- **Chat Memory Badge Reliability**: Chat now buffers memory telemetry that can arrive before assistant content chunks and deterministically attaches it to the next assistant message.

### Fixed

- **Desktop Permission Routing**: Permission prompts now stay scoped to the active session, preventing cross-session/parallel-client approval leakage into the wrong chat.
- **Question Overlay Recovery**: Desktop now normalizes `permission(tool=question)` into question-request UI flow so walkthrough prompts consistently appear in the modal.
- **Plan Mode Todo Reliability**: Fixed repeated `todo_write` no-op loops (`0 items`) by normalizing common todo payload aliases (`tasks`, `items`, checklist/text forms) and skipping empty todo calls.
- **Plan Mode Clarification Flow**: When planning cannot produce concrete todos, the engine now emits a structured `question.asked` fallback instead of silently proceeding with prose-only clarification.
- **Todo Fallback Precision**: Todo extraction fallback now ignores plain prose and only derives tasks from structured checklist/numbered lines, preventing accidental phantom tasks.
- **Silent Prompt Failures in TUI**: Stream failures are now surfaced from runtime events (`session.error` and failed `session.run.finished`) instead of appearing as no-response hangs.
- **Run Stream Stability**: Fixed run-scoped SSE handling so unrelated events do not prematurely terminate active stream processing.
- **No-Response Completion Case**: Added explicit fallback error messaging when a run completes without streamed deltas or assistant content.
- **Provider Auth in TUI**: Fixed a key-discovery mismatch that prevented existing desktop-stored keys from being recognized by TUI.
- **Engine Download Retry in TUI**: Download failures no longer lock out retries for the remainder of the process; retry/backoff now allows recovery without restarting TUI.
- **Debug Engine Bootstrap Fallback**: Debug builds now fall back to release download when no local dev engine binary is found.
- **Keystore Corruption Routing**: Unreadable/corrupt keystore files now route to create/recovery behavior instead of trapping users in unlock failures.
- **Request Visibility**: Replaced noisy in-transcript request activity lines with dedicated request/status UI.
- **Permission Clarity in Plan Mode**: Request modal now shows mode/tool context and explains why permission is requested, including `tool: question` previews.
- **Question Handling**: Added custom-answer support alongside multiple-choice options and fixed `permission(tool=question)` normalization into question-answer flow.
- **Skills Discovery Determinism**: Duplicate skill names are now resolved by deterministic priority (project roots override global roots).
- **Windows `tandem-memory` Test Linking**: Fixed MSVC CRT mismatch (`LNK2038`, `MT_StaticRelease` vs `MD_DynamicRelease`) by vendoring/patching `esaxx-rs` to avoid static CRT linkage in this workspace.
- **Corrupt Memory DB Startup Recovery**: Added SQLite integrity validation (`PRAGMA quick_check`) at memory DB startup so malformed databases are detected and auto-backed-up/reset before runtime writes.
- **Session Rehydration Gaps**: Fixed missing memory retrieval/storage telemetry after reload by rehydrating persisted memory rows into assistant message badges and console history.
- **Idle Stream Health**: Stream watchdog no longer marks the desktop stream as degraded when idle without active runs or tool calls.

## [0.3.0-rc.1] - 2026-02-14

### Added

- **Web Markdown Extraction**: Added `webfetch_document` to convert HTML into clean Markdown with links, metadata, and size stats.

- **Tool Arg Integrity Pipeline**: Added normalized tool-arg handling across permission + execution boundaries with websearch query-source tracking.
- **Dev Sidecar Build Handshake**: Added `/global/health` build metadata (`build_id`, `binary_path`) and desktop mismatch diagnostics.

### Docs

- **Engine Testing Guide**: Added tool testing workflows, size savings example, and Windows quickstart for tauri dev.

### Fixed

- **Websearch Empty-Args Failures**: Prevented repeated `websearch` executions with `{}` by recovering/inferencing queries and emitting explicit terminal errors when unrecoverable.
- **Websearch Looping**: Added read-only dedupe and loop-guard controls for repeated identical `websearch` calls.
- **Provider Auth Error Clarity**: Provider auth failures now emit provider-specific API key guidance (for example OpenRouter key hints).
- **Desktop External Links**: Markdown links in assistant messages now open reliably through Tauri opener integration.

## [0.2.25] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **Canonical Marketing Skills (Core 9)**: Added starter skill templates for `product-marketing-context`, `content-strategy`, `seo-audit`, `social-content`, `copywriting`, `copy-editing`, `email-sequence`, `competitor-alternatives`, and `launch-strategy`.
- **Marketing Skills Canonical Map**: Added `docs/marketing_skill_canonical_map.md` to document no-duplicate routing and fallback strategy.

### Changed

- **Skill Template Install Behavior**: `skills_install_template` now installs the full template directory recursively (not just `SKILL.md`), so bundled `references/`, scripts, and assets ship with installs.
- **Marketing Starter Ordering**: Updated `SkillsPanel` recommendations to prioritize canonical marketing skills over legacy/fallback templates for marketing-intent discovery.
- **Shared Marketing Context Path**: Replaced `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` references with `scripts/marketing/_shared/product-marketing-context.md` and included shared context template references.

### Fixed

- **Skill Template Parsing Reliability**: Re-saved template `SKILL.md` files in UTF-8 without BOM to prevent false `missing or malformed frontmatter (---...---)` parser failures.
- **Template Frontmatter YAML**: Fixed invalid `tags` format in `development-estimation` and `mode-builder` (`string` -> YAML sequence).
- **Legacy Marketing Template Labeling**: Updated overlapping bundled marketing templates to clearly indicate legacy/fallback usage.
- **Version Metadata Sync**: Bumped version to `0.2.25` across app metadata for release consistency.

## [0.2.24] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **Custom Modes (Phased MVP Complete)**: Added end-to-end custom mode support with backend-authoritative enforcement, including mode listing, create/update/delete, import/export, deterministic precedence (`builtin < user < project`), and safe fallback behavior.
- **Guided Mode Builder**: Added a non-technical, step-by-step mode creation wizard in `Extensions -> Modes`.
- **Mode Management in Extensions**: Added a dedicated `Modes` area under `Extensions` with `Guided Builder` and `Advanced Editor` views.
- **AI-Assisted Mode Builder**: Added optional AI assist flow in Guided Builder with:
  - `Start AI Builder Chat`
  - paste-and-parse JSON preview before apply
  - new bundled skill template: `mode-builder`
- **Mode Icons**: Added selectable mode icons that render in chat mode selector UI.

### Changed

- **Chat Mode Selector**: Mode selector now loads built-in + custom modes dynamically and uses compact descriptions for custom entries.
- **Memory Indexing Default**: `auto_index_on_project_load` now defaults to `true` for new users/devices.

### Fixed

- **Version Metadata Sync**: Updated `tauri.conf.json`, `package.json`, and `Cargo.toml` so auto-updates detect new releases correctly.

## [0.2.23] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **Global Activity Indicators**: Added top-right runtime badges for concurrent background work (`CHATTING` and `ORCHESTRATING` counts) so active work remains visible while navigating between sessions/views.
- **Session List Running State UX**: Added explicit running status indicators in the Sessions sidebar for active chat sessions and orchestrator runs.
- **Orchestrator Budget Controls**: Added in-panel budget actions so users can extend run limits (`Add Budget Headroom`) or relax caps for long-running orchestrations (`Relax Max Caps`) without starting over.

### Changed

- **Session Selection Behavior**: Selecting a normal chat session now exits Orchestrator panel mode and clears stale selected run context.
- **Sidebar Status Presentation**: Refined running indicators to avoid duplicate spinners and keep status signal in a consistent location (`RUNNING` on the metadata line).
- **Chat Activity Accounting**: Chat running counts now derive from global sidecar stream events (session-scoped), not only the currently mounted chat component state.

### Fixed

- **Orchestrator Console Persistence**: Fixed orchestrator Console tab history clearing on drawer reopen by scoping logs to run sessions and loading persisted tool events across base + task child sessions.
- **Orchestrator Console Live Scope**: Fixed Console stream bleed by filtering live tool events to only the orchestrator run's related session IDs.
- **Orchestrator Retry Error Visibility**: Fixed retry/restart failures being visible only in logs by surfacing run failure reasons directly in Orchestrator UI alerts.
- **Orchestrator Failure Context**: Improved terminal failure messaging to include concrete failed-task error details (e.g. provider/model-not-found) instead of generic max-retry text.
- **Orchestrator Budget Recovery**: Fixed budget-limit dead ends by allowing failed budget runs to move back to resumable state after caps are increased.
- **Concurrent Chat Session Indicators**: Fixed sidebar/chat-header indicators dropping when switching selection by tracking running sessions globally and rendering status per session ID.
- **Budget Warning Log Spam**: Throttled repetitive orchestrator budget warning logs (e.g. `wall_time at 80%`) to log on meaningful threshold progression/cooldown instead of every loop tick.

## [0.2.22] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed

- **Orchestrator Run Isolation by Project**: Prevented Orchestrator mode from reusing a stale run across projects by clearing selected run state when switching/adding projects and scoping run selection to the active workspace.
- **Orchestrator Auto-Resume Behavior**: Opening Orchestrator with no explicit run now auto-resumes only active runs (`planning`, `awaiting_approval`, `executing`, `paused`) instead of reopening terminal/completed history by default.

## [0.2.21] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **Model Selector Provider Filter**: Added an explicit provider selector inside the chat model dropdown (`All` + visible providers) so users can narrow large catalogs without horizontal scrolling.
- **Provider-Aware Search Token**: Added `provider:<id-or-name>` support in model search (for example `provider:openrouter sonnet`) to quickly scope results from the keyboard.

### Changed

- **Model Selector UX**: Replaced horizontal provider chips with a compact full-width provider dropdown for better scalability with many providers.
- **Model Selector Clarity**: Added helper copy ("Showing configured providers + local") to explain why some providers are hidden by default.
- **Provider Filter Behavior**: Provider filters now reset safely to `All` when a previously selected provider is no longer available after model reload.

### Fixed

- **Provider-Scoped Empty State**: Empty states in model selection now explain when no matches exist for the active provider filter.
- **Fullscreen File Preview Readability**: Increased fullscreen preview opacity and backdrop strength so file content remains readable on highly transparent/gradient themes (e.g. Pink Pony) instead of blending into the app background.

## [0.2.20] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **Sidecar Update Compatibility Metadata**: Sidecar status now exposes `latestOverallVersion` and `compatibilityMessage` so the UI can clearly explain when newest overall and newest compatible releases differ.
- **Global Stream Hub**: Added a single long-lived sidecar stream substrate (`stream_hub`) that fans out events to chat, orchestrator, and Ralph, reducing duplicate subscriptions and race-prone stream wiring.
- **Event Envelope v2 (Additive)**: Added `sidecar_event_v2` with envelope metadata (`event_id`, `correlation_id`, `ts_ms`, `session_id`, `source`, `payload`) while keeping legacy `sidecar_event` for compatibility.
- **Stream Health Signaling**: Added explicit stream health events (`healthy`, `degraded`, `recovering`) emitted from the backend and surfaced in chat UI.
- **Chat Message Queue IPC**: Added queue APIs for busy-agent workflows: `queue_message`, `queue_list`, `queue_remove`, `queue_send_next`, `queue_send_all`.
- **Skills Import Preview + Conflict Policies**: Added `skills_import_preview` and `skills_import` with deterministic conflict strategies: `skip`, `overwrite`, `rename`.
- **Skills Pack/Zip Import Support**: Added multi-skill zip import parsing (`SKILL.md` discovery) with pre-apply preview summary.
- **Richer Skill Metadata Surface**: Expanded skill metadata handling to include `version`, `author`, `tags`, `requires`, `compatibility`, and `triggers`.

### Fixed

- **OpenCode Sidecar Release Discovery**: Sidecar update checks now query GitHub Releases with pagination (`per_page=20`, multi-page) instead of relying on a single latest path.
- **Update Target Selection**: Sidecar updater now selects the newest compatible release for the current platform/architecture by filtering assets from release metadata and skipping drafts (and prereleases unless beta channel is enabled).
- **Rate Limit Resilience**: Added conditional GitHub requests (`If-None-Match`, `If-Modified-Since`), local release-cache reuse, and check debouncing to reduce API pressure and improve reliability when offline/rate-limited.
- **Version Comparison Correctness**: Updater now uses semantic version comparison (with fallback parsing) to prevent incorrect update prompts from string-based version checks.
- **Sidecar Update Messaging**: Improved update overlay messaging to surface compatibility context instead of always presenting newest-tag text.
- **Console History Persistence**: Fixed historical tool executions not loading in the Console tab by correctly parsing persisted `type: "tool"` messages (which differ from live streaming format) and simplifying part-ID resolution.
- **Chat Jump Button**: Fixed "Jump to latest" button floating in the middle of the view by positioning it as an absolute overlay at the bottom of the message area, independent of scroll content height.
- **Streaming Subscription Duplication**: Eliminated per-request stream subscription in `send_message_streaming`; message streaming now uses shared stream bus events, reducing duplicate event emission risks.
- **Memory Retrieval Event Handling in Chat**: Wired frontend handling for `memory_retrieval` stream events so retrieval telemetry is now visible in the active chat flow.
- **Orchestrator/Ralph Stream Contention**: Migrated orchestrator and Ralph loop event consumption to stream-hub fanout instead of opening independent sidecar event feeds.
- **Chat Event Duplication Under Load**: Added deterministic frontend dedupe keyed by `event_id` for v2 stream envelopes.

### Changed

- **Streaming Architecture**: Shifted Tandem to a hub-first streaming model with additive v2 envelopes and backward-compatible legacy event emission during migration.
- **Chat UX During Generation**: Pressing Enter while generation is active now queues messages (FIFO) with inline queue controls for send-next/send-all/remove.
- **Tool Activity Presentation**: Updated inline assistant tool summary to show compact process-oriented status (step count, running/pending/failed counts, duration) with detail drill-down retained.

## [0.2.19] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **Memory Retrieval Telemetry**: Chat requests now run memory retrieval before sending prompts, emit a `memory_retrieval` stream event, and include balanced telemetry (usage, chunk counts, latency, score range, short query hash) without logging raw query text or chunk contents.
- **Chat Memory Badge**: Assistant responses now show a memory capsule with a brain icon and retrieval status (used/not used, chunks, latency) for verifiable retrieval visibility per response.
- **Console Tab (Logs Drawer)**: Added a dedicated Console tab for tool-execution events and approvals in the Logs drawer workflow.

### Fixed

- **Memory Retrieval Coverage**: Wired retrieval context injection into both `send_message` and `send_message_streaming` so normal chat requests can actually use indexed vector memory.
- **Sidecar Duplicate Spawn Race**: Prevented duplicate OpenCode/Bun sidecar launches by serializing sidecar start/stop lifecycle transitions with a lifecycle lock.
- **Logs Drawer Fullscreen Height**: Fixed logs panel sizing so height is fully dynamic in fullscreen instead of staying at the smaller constrained height.
- **Logs Redundancy**: Removed the redundant OpenCode sidecar log tab from the logs viewer and consolidated command activity under the Console tab.
- **Pink Pony Readability**: Tuned Pink Pony theme contrast, surface opacity, borders, and text colors to improve legibility on bright backgrounds.
- **Chat Performance**: Significantly improved rendering performance for long chat sessions by implementing list virtualization and component memoization.
- **Production Build**: Fixed a TypeScript error in the Logs Drawer component (`ResizeObserver` type mismatch) that was blocking production builds.

### Changed

- **Memory Log Signal**: Memory retrieval logging now uses a distinct `tandem.memory` target and a brain marker for easier scanning in logs.
- **Production Frontend Build**: Production Vite builds now drop `console.*` and `debugger` statements.

## [0.2.18] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- **Python**: Auto-open the Python Setup (Workspace Venv) wizard when Python is blocked by venv-only policy enforcement (helps LLM-triggered Python attempts recover quickly).
- **Python**: Extend venv-only enforcement to staged/batch execution (preflight staged operations before approving any tool calls).
- **Python**: Add a shared policy helper + tests for consistent enforcement across approval paths.
- **Packs (Python)**: Add `requirements.txt` to the Data Visualization and Finance Analysis packs; update their docs to install via the workspace venv.
- **Packs**: Install pack-level `CONTRIBUTING.md` when present (copied alongside `START_HERE.md`).
- **Files**: Add a dock mount + fullscreen toggle for file previews.

### Fixed

- **Skills/Templates**: Fix bundled starter skill templates with missing YAML frontmatter fields so they no longer get skipped on startup.
- **Python**: Improve the requirements install UX by defaulting to the workspace and auto-detecting `requirements*.txt` when present.

### Known Issues

- **Files Auto-Refresh (WIP)**: The Files tree does not reliably refresh when tools/AI create new files in the workspace. Deeper investigation needed; workaround is to navigate away and back to Files.

## [0.2.17] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed

- **Custom Background Opacity Slider (Packaged Builds)**: Fix opacity changes causing the background image to flash or disappear in bundled builds by keeping the resolved image URL stable and updating only opacity.
- **Background Layering**: Render the custom background image as a dedicated fixed layer so it consistently appears across views without impacting overlay layout.

## [0.2.16] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed

- **Update Overlay Layout**: Fix the in-app update prompt becoming constrained/squished due to theme background layering CSS.

## [0.2.15] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed

- **Custom Background Image Loading (Packaged Builds)**: Fix custom background images failing to load after updating by falling back to an in-memory `data:` URL when the `asset:` URL fails.

## [0.2.14] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- **Themes: Background Art Pass**: Add richer background art for Cosmic Glass (starfield + galaxy glow), Pink Pony (thick arcing rainbow), and Zen Dusk (minimalist ink + sage haze).
- **Theme Background Support**: Add an `app-background` utility class so gradient theme backgrounds render correctly throughout the app (not just as a solid `background-color`).
- **Custom Background Image Overlay**: Allow users to choose a background image (copied into app data) and overlay it on top of the active theme, with an opacity slider in Settings.
- **File Text Extraction (Rust)**: Add best-effort, cross-platform text extraction for common document formats (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX/XLS/ODS/XLSB, RTF) via the `read_file_text` command so attachments can be used by skills without requiring Python.
- **Python Workspace Venv Wizard**: Add a cross-platform in-app Python setup wizard to create a workspace-scoped venv at `.opencode/.venv` and install dependencies into it (never global).
- **Docs: Theme Contribution Guide**: Add guidance for creating and iterating on theme backgrounds.

### Fixed

- **Settings/About/Extensions Navigation**: Restore Settings/About/Extensions panels after a regression where these views would not appear.
- **Overlay Layering**: Ensure theme/background layers render consistently across main views (chat + settings) without unintended translucency.
- **Startup Session Restore**: Fix restored sessions appearing selected but not opening until reselecting the folder (defer history load until the sidecar is running; allow re-clicking the selected session to reload).

### Changed

- **Packs UI**: Style runtime requirement pills consistently.

## [0.2.13] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- **Skill Templates: New Starter Skills**: Add two new bundled starter skills: `brainstorming` and `development-estimation`.
- **Skill Templates: Runtime Pills**: Starter skill cards now show optional runtime hints (e.g. Python/Node/Bash) via `requires: [...]` YAML frontmatter.
- **Skills UI: Installed Skill Discoverability**: Add clearer install/manage UX (runtime note, counts for folder vs global installs, and a jump-to-installed action).

### Fixed

- **Dev Skill Template Discovery**: In `tauri dev`, load starter skill templates from `src-tauri/resources/skill-templates/` so newly added templates appear immediately (avoids stale `target/**/resources/**` copies).
- **Logs Viewer UX**: Improve log viewer usability (fullscreen mode, and copy feedback).
- **Skill Template Parsing**: Fix invalid bundled skill template frontmatter (missing `name`) so it is not skipped.

### Changed

- **Packs UI**: Show packs only (remove starter skills section) and move the runtime note to the top of the Packs page.
- **Docs**: Expand contributor documentation with a developer guide for adding skills.

## [0.2.12] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed

- **Orchestrator Model Routing**: Persist the selected provider/model on orchestrator runs and prefer it when sending prompts so runs don't start with an "unknown" model or send messages without an explicit model spec.
- **Orchestrator Restart/Retries**: Prevent "restart" from instantly reporting success without doing any work (guard against empty plans; allow restarting completed runs to rerun the full plan).
- **Logs Viewer Copy/Scroll**: Make long log lines easy to inspect and share (horizontal scroll + selected-line preview + copy helpers).
- **Orchestrator Run Deletion**: Allow deleting orchestrator runs from the Sessions sidebar (removes the run from disk and deletes its backing OpenCode session).
- **Release to Discord**: Automated releases now post to Discord via the release workflow (release:published events triggered by `GITHUB_TOKEN` are not delivered to other workflows).
- **Release to Discord**: Ensure Discord notifications fire for automated releases by posting from the release workflow (instead of relying on `release: published`, which doesn't trigger when publishing via `GITHUB_TOKEN`).

## [0.2.11] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- **On-Demand Logs Viewer**: Add a right-side Logs drawer that can tail Tandem app log files (from the app data `logs/` directory) and show OpenCode sidecar stdout/stderr (captured into a bounded in-memory ring buffer). Streaming only runs while the drawer is open/active to avoid baseline performance cost.
- **Poe Provider**: Add Poe as an OpenAI-compatible provider option (endpoint + `POE_API_KEY`). Thanks [@CamNoob](https://github.com/CamNoob).

### Fixed

- **OpenCode Session Hangs**: Prevent sessions from getting stuck indefinitely when a tool invocation never reaches a terminal state by recognizing more terminal tool statuses, ignoring heartbeat/diff noise in the stream, and fail-fast cancelling with a surfaced error after a timeout.
- **Sidecar StdIO Deadlock Risk**: Always drain the OpenCode sidecar stdout/stderr pipes so the sidecar cannot block if it emits high-volume output.
- **Log Noise Reduction**: Ignore OpenCode `server.*` heartbeat SSE events (and downgrade other unknown SSE events) to prevent log spam during long-running sessions.
- **Vault Locked Log Spam**: Avoid warning-level logs when the keystore isn't available because the vault is locked (expected state).
- **Release Pipeline Resilience**: Retry GitHub Release asset uploads to reduce flakes during transient GitHub errors.

## [0.2.10] - 2026-02-09 (Failed Release)

- Release attempt failed due to GitHub release asset upload errors during a GitHub incident; no assets were published. v0.2.11 re-cuts the same changes.

## [0.2.9] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- **Project File Indexing**: Add an incremental, per-project file index for workspace embeddings with total/percent progress reporting.
- **Memory Stats Scope**: Switch Vector Database Stats between All Projects and Active Project views.
- **Auto-Index Toggle**: Optionally auto-index the active project on load (with a short cooldown).
- **Clear File Index**: Clear only file-derived vectors/chunks for a project (optional VACUUM) to reclaim space.

### Fixed

- **Question Prompts**: Properly handle OpenCode `question.asked` events (including multi-question requests) and render an interactive one-at-a-time wizard with multiple-choice + custom answers; replies are sent via the OpenCode `/question/{requestID}/reply` API.
- **Startup Session History**: When restoring the last active project on launch, automatically load its sessions by scoping OpenCode `/session` and `/project` listing calls to the active workspace directory.
- **Windows Dev Reload Sidecar Cleanup**: Prevent orphaned OpenCode sidecar (and Bun) processes when the app is restarted during `tauri dev` rebuilds by attaching the sidecar to a Windows Job Object (kill-on-close).

## [0.2.8] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- **Multi Custom Providers (OpenCode)**: Support selecting any provider from the OpenCode sidecar catalog (including user-defined providers by name in `.opencode/config.json`), not just the built-in set.

### Fixed

- **Model Selection Routing**: Persist the selected `provider_id` + `model_id` and prefer it when sending messages, so switching to non-standard providers actually takes effect.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed

- **OpenCode Config Safety**: Prevent OpenCode config writes from deleting an existing `opencode.json` when replacement fails (e.g. file locked on Windows).
- **Sidecar Idle Memory**: Set Bun/JSC memory env hints to reduce excessive idle memory usage.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed

- **macOS Release Builds**: Disabled codesigning/notarization by default in the release workflow to prevent macOS builds from failing when Apple certificate secrets are missing or misconfigured. (Enable with `MACOS_SIGNING_ENABLED=true` repo variable.)

## [0.2.5] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed

- **Release Build Trigger**: Bumped version/tag to ensure GitHub Releases builds run with the corrected workflow configuration.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- **Vector DB Stats (Settings)**: Added a Memory section in Settings to view vector database stats and manually index the current workspace.
- **macOS Release Verification**: Release/CI now includes Gatekeeper checks (`codesign`, `spctl`, `stapler validate`) for produced DMGs (informational unless Apple signing secrets are configured).

### Fixed

- **Starter Pack Installs (Windows/macOS/Linux)**: Fixed pack/template resolution in packaged builds so Starter Packs and Starter Skills can be installed correctly from bundled resources.
- **Onboarding For Custom Providers**: Custom providers (e.g. LM Studio / OpenAI-compatible endpoints) are now treated as “configured”, preventing onboarding from forcing users back to Settings.
- **Pack Install Errors**: Pack install failures now surface the underlying error message in the UI.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed

- **Orchestration Session Spam**: Orchestration no longer creates endless new root chat sessions during execution.
  - Sub-agent/task sessions are now created as child sessions (so they don't flood the main session list).
  - Session listing now prefers root sessions only, with a fallback for older sidecars.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- **Knowledge Work Skills Migration**: Completed the migration of all legacy knowledge work skills to the Tandem format.
  - **Productivity Pack**: `productivity-memory`, `productivity-tasks`, `productivity-start`, `productivity-update`, `inbox-triage`, `meeting-notes`, `research-synthesis`, `writing-polish`.
  - **Sales Pack**: `sales-account-research`, `sales-call-prep`, `sales-competitive-intelligence`, `sales-create-asset`, `sales-daily-briefing`, `sales-draft-outreach`.
  - **Bio-Informatics Pack**: `bio-instrument-data`, `bio-nextflow-manager`, `bio-research-strategy`, `bio-single-cell`, `bio-strategy`.

  - **Enterprise Knowledge Pack**: `enterprise-knowledge-synthesis`, `enterprise-search-knowledge`, `enterprise-search-source`, `enterprise-search-strategy`, `enterprise-source-management`.
  - **Finance Pack**: `finance-income-statement`, `finance-journal-entry`, `finance-reconciliation`, `finance-sox-testing`, `finance-variance-analysis`.
  - **Legal Pack**: `legal-canned-responses`, `legal-compliance`, `legal-contract-review`, `legal-meeting-briefing`, `legal-nda-triage`, `legal-risk-assessment`.
  - **Marketing Pack**: `marketing-brand-voice`, `marketing-campaign-planning`, `marketing-competitive-analysis`, `marketing-content-creation`, `marketing-performance-analytics`.
  - **Product Pack**: `product-competitive-analysis`, `product-feature-spec`, `product-metrics`, `product-roadmap`, `product-stakeholder-comms`, `product-user-research`.
  - **Support Pack**: `support-customer-research`, `support-escalation`, `support-knowledge-management`, `support-response-drafting`, `support-ticket-triage`.
  - **Design & Frontend Pack**: `canvas-design`, `theme-factory`, `frontend-design`, `web-artifacts-builder`, `algorithmic-art`.
  - **Internal Comms**: `internal-comms`.
  - **Utilities**: `cowork-mcp-config-assistant`.
- **Skill Templates**: All migrated skills are now available as offline-compatible templates in the `src-tauri/resources/skill-templates` directory.
- **Brand Neutralization**: All skills have been updated to be model-agnostic, removing dependencies on specific AI providers.
- **Extensions**: New top-level Extensions area with tabs for Skills, Plugins, and Integrations (MCP).
- **MCP Integrations UI**: Add/remove remote HTTP and local stdio MCP servers with scope support (Global vs Folder).
- **MCP Presets**: Added popular remote presets (including Context7 and DeepWiki) for quick setup.
- **Skills Search**: Added a search box to filter both Starter skills and Installed skills.
- **New Skill Template**: `youtube-scriptwriter` starter skill template.

### Improved

- **MCP Test Connection**: Test now performs a protocol-correct MCP `initialize` POST and validates JSON-RPC (including SSE responses) instead of using HEAD/GET.
- **MCP Status UX**: More accurate status mapping and actionable error messages (auth required, wrong URL, incompatible transport, deprecated endpoint).

### Fixed

- MCP connection tests no longer report "Connected" for non-2xx HTTP responses like 405/410.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- **Guided onboarding wizard** to drive a first outcome (choose folder → connect AI → run starter workflow).
- **Starter Packs**: bundled, offline workflow packs you can install into a folder from inside the app.
- **Starter Skills gallery**: bundled, offline skill templates with an “Advanced: paste SKILL.md” option retained.
- **Contributor hygiene**: GitHub issue/PR templates and new product/architecture docs at repo root.

### Improved

- **Orchestration reliability**:
  - Increased default budgets (iterations/sub-agent runs) and auto-upgraded legacy runs with too-low limits.
  - Provider rate-limit/quota errors now **pause** runs (instead of burning retries) so you can switch model/provider and resume.
- **Provider switching**: fixed stale env var propagation by explicitly syncing/removing provider API key env vars and restarting sidecar when provider toggles change.
- **CI confidence**: frontend lint now fails the build instead of being ignored.

### Fixed

- Orchestrator could “explode” sub-agent runs due to tasks not being marked finished on error (leading to endless requeue/recovery loops).
- Model/provider could not be changed after a run failed; model selection is now available to recover and resume.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Introduced a major new mode for complex task execution.
  - **Task DAG**: Supports dependency-aware task graphs (Planner -> Builder -> Validator).
  - **Sub-Agents**: Orchestrates specialized agents for planning, coding, and verifying.
  - **Cost & Safety**: Implements strict budget controls (tokens, time, iterations) and policy-based tool gating.
  - **Visualize**: New Kanban board and budget meter to track progress in real-time.
- **Unified Session Sidebar**: Completely redesigned the sidebar to merge chat sessions and orchestrator runs into a single, cohesive chronological list.
  - **Project Grouping**: Items are smartly grouped by project with sticky headers.
  - **Status Indicators**: Orchestrator runs show live status (Running, Completed, Failed).

## [0.1.15] - 2026-02-03

### Added

- **Unified Update UI**: Replaced the disparate update experiences for OpenCode (Sidecar) and Tandem (App) with a single, polished, full-screen overlay component.
- **Conflict Resolution**: The new `AppUpdateOverlay` takes precedence over other update screens, ensuring that app updates (which restart the application) are handled cleanly and avoid conflicts with sidecar updates.

## [0.1.14] - 2026-01-31

### Improved

- **Ralph Loop Reliability**: Updated the prompt engineering for both Ralph Loop and Plan Execution modes to explicitly enforce the use of the `todowrite` tool. This ensures that tasks are visually marked as "completed" in the UI as the AI finishes them, preventing the state desync where work was done but tasks remained unchecked.
- **Task Execution Flow**: When executing approved tasks from the Plan sidebar, the system now provides stronger directives to the AI to update task status immediately upon completion.

## [0.1.13] - 2026-01-30

### Added

- **Ralph Loop**: Implemented iterative task execution mode with the following features:
  - New `ralph` Rust module with `RalphLoopManager`, `RalphStorage`, and `RalphRunHandle`
  - Toggle button in chat control bar to enable/disable loop mode
  - Status chip showing current iteration and status (Running/Paused/Completed/Error)
  - Side panel with pause/resume/cancel controls and context injection
  - Completion detection via `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` token matching
  - Struggle detection after 3 iterations with no file changes or repeated errors
  - Git-based file change tracking between iterations
  - Workspace-local storage at `.opencode/tandem/ralph/` (state.json, history.json, context.md)
  - Seven Tauri commands: `ralph_start`, `ralph_cancel`, `ralph_pause`, `ralph_resume`, `ralph_add_context`, `ralph_status`, `ralph_history`
  - Plan Mode integration - Ralph respects staging and never auto-executes
  - Frontend components: `LoopToggle`, `LoopStatusChip`, `RalphPanel`
- **Memory Context System**: Integrated a semantic memory store using `sqlite-vec`. This allows the AI to store and retrieve context from past sessions and project documentation, enabling long-term memory and smarter context-aware responses.

### Fixed

- **Memory Store Initialization**: Resolved an `unresolved import sqlite_vec::sqlite_vec` error by correctly implementing the `sqlite3_vec_init` C-extension registration via `rusqlite`.

## [0.1.13] - 2026-01-30

### Added

- **Planning Mode**: Introduced a dedicated planning agent that generates comprehensive markdown-based implementation plans before executing code changes. Includes support for real-time plan file synchronization and a specialized UI for plan management.
- **Plan File Watcher**: Backend file watcher for `.opencode/plans/` that automatically updates the UI when plans are modified, ensuring the frontend is always in sync with the AI's latest proposals.
- **Ask Follow-up Question**: Integrated support for the `ask_followup_question` tool in the planning process, allowing the AI to clarify scope and technical preferences with interactive suggestion buttons.

### Fixed

- **Backend Compilation**: Resolved a critical "no method named `get_workspace_path` found" error in `commands.rs` by adding the missing method to `AppState`.
- **Tool Parsing Accuracy**: Improved sidecar communication by strictly enforcing tool name formatting (removing potential leading spaces) and correcting invalid tool examples in the plan skill instructions.

### Changed

- **Planning Flow**: Streamlined the transition from plan to execution. The AI is now instructed to generate plans immediately without conversational filler, using strict system directives.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-01-22

### Fixed

- **File Viewer**: Fixed "Failed to load directory" error by removing overly restrictive path allowlist checks that were causing Windows path normalization issues.
- **Permission Spam**: Prevented repeated approval prompts for the same tool request.
- **Allow All Auto-Approval**: Aligned auto-approval with permission request IDs to stop duplicate prompts.
- **Session Switching**: Cleared pending permission state when switching sessions to avoid stale approvals.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-01-22

### Fixed

- **Version Metadata**: Fixed version numbers in `tauri.conf.json`, `package.json`, and `Cargo.toml` to ensure proper auto-update detection. Previous release (v0.1.10) had mismatched version metadata (some files were 0.1.8 or 0.1.9 while the built version was 0.1.10), causing update failures.
- **File Access Guardrails**: Enforced workspace allowlist checks for file browsing, text reads, and binary reads to prevent unintended access outside the active workspace.
- **Windows Path Denylist**: Normalized Windows path separators so deny patterns like `.env` and key files reliably block access.
- **Binary Read Limits**: Added size limits for binary reads to avoid large base64 payloads.
- **Log Noise**: Removed verbose streaming and provider debug logs to reduce UI overhead during active sessions.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-01-22

### Added

- **Skills Management UI**: Added a complete skills management interface in Settings, allowing users to import, view, and manage OpenCode-compatible skills (both project-specific and global).
- **Skill Discovery**: Implemented automatic discovery of installed skills from both project (`.opencode/skill/`) and global (`~/.config/opencode/skills/`) directories.
- **Smart Project Selection**: Skills panel now displays the active project name and automatically disables project-specific installation when no project is selected.
- **Skill Resource Links**: Added clickable links to popular skill repositories (open skills library, SkillHub, GitHub) using Tauri's native URL opener.
- **Automatic Sidecar Restart**: Implemented seamless AI engine restart after skill import with a full-screen overlay matching the app's aesthetic. Features animated rotating icon, pulsing progress bars, and backdrop blur.

### Fixed

- **Skills Import Reliability**: Fixed critical bug where SKILL.md files with YAML frontmatter containing colons (e.g., "for: (1)") would fail to parse. The parser now automatically quotes descriptions with special characters.
- **Skills Save Format**: Fixed issue where imported skills were being reconstructed incorrectly, causing frontmatter corruption. Skills are now saved with their original content preserved.
- **TypeScript Errors**: Resolved missing `projectPath` prop type in SkillsPanel component.
- **External Links**: Fixed broken external links in Skills panel to use Tauri's `openUrl()` instead of non-functional `href` attributes.

### Changed

- **Button Styling**: Cleaned up Save button appearance by removing emoji for a more professional look.
- **Project Name Display**: Improved visual hierarchy in project selection with bold primary-colored project names and muted path indicators.
- **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive debug logging for skill discovery and YAML parsing to improve troubleshooting.
- **Auto-Refresh**: Skills list now properly refreshes after importing new skills by awaiting the refresh callback.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed

- **macOS Styling:** Refined the glass effect styling and other UI polish to improve the overall look and feel on macOS.
- **BaseHref Support:** Added support for `baseHref` in HTML previews to correctly resolve relative paths for images and stylesheets.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed

- **Slides Workflow Feedback Loop:** Refined the presentation guidance to be more flexible, ensuring the AI acknowledges user feedback/improvements during the planning phase instead of jumping immediately to execution.
- **"Add to Chat" Reliability:** Fixed a state management bug in `ChatInput` that prevented HTML files and other external attachments from being correctly added to the chat context.
- **Blur Obstruction:** Removed the `blur(6px)` transition from the `Message` component and streaming indicator, preventing the chat from becoming unreadable during active AI generation.
- **High-Fidelity PDF Export:** Added `@page { margin: 0; size: landscape; }` and `color-adjust` CSS to the HTML slide template to suppress browser headers/footers and preserve professional aesthetics during PDF export.
- **File Link Detection (Chat UI):** Refined the file path detection regex to only match explicit paths (containing slashes or drive letters), preventing normal text from being incorrectly rendered as "jarbled" clickable links.
- **Dynamic Ollama Discovery:** Implemented automatic model discovery for local Ollama instances. The application now dynamically generates the sidecar configuration based on actually installed local models, ensuring a seamless zero-config experience across all platforms.
- **Cross-Platform Config Reliability:** Updated the sidecar manager to correctly handle OpenCode configuration paths on Linux, macOS, and Windows, and bundled a default template in the installer for improved auto-update reliability.
- **Settings Synchronization:** Fixed a bug where changing the model/provider in settings was not immediately reflected in the Chat interface.
- **Model Selector Refinement:** Cleaned up the model dropdown to prioritize OpenCode Zen/Ollama and hide unconfigured providers, reducing clutter.
- **"Allow All" Logic:** Fixed a critical issue where the "Allow All" toggle was ignored by the event handler, implementing robust auto-approval logic for permissions.
- **Chat History Visibility:** Improved session list filtering to strictly handle project path normalization, ensuring only relevant project chats are shown while preventing history loss.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-01-20

### Added

- **High-Fidelity HTML Slides:** Replaced legacy PPTX generation with an interactive 16:9 HTML slideshow system featuring Chart.js integration, keyboard navigation, optimized PDF export via a dedicated Print button, content overflow protection, and strict density limits (max 6 items per slide).
- **Collapsible Tool Outputs:** Large tool outputs (like `todowrite` or file operations) are now collapsed by default in the chat view, reducing visual noise. Users can expand them to see full details.
- **Chart Generation Capabilities:** Updated internal marketing documentation to highlight the new capability of generating interactive visual dashboards directly from research data.
- HTML Canvas/Report feature: render interactive HTML files in a sandboxed iframe with Tailwind, Chart.js, and Font Awesome support.
- "Research" tool category with dedicated instructions for a robust "Search → Select → Fetch" workflow.
- Visibility of AI reasoning/thinking parts in both live streaming and chat history.
- Automatic persistence of the current active session across reloads/refreshes.
- Default "allow" rules for safe tools (`ls`, `read`, `todowrite`, `websearch`, `webfetch`) to reduce permission prompts.

### Fixed

- **[REDACTED] Filtering:** Removed spurious `[REDACTED]` markers that were leaking from OpenCode's internal reasoning output into the chat UI.
- **File Link Detection (Critical Fix):** Completely rewrote the file path regex to reliably detect Unix absolute paths like `/home/user/file.html` in chat messages, making them clickable.
- **Slide Layout & Scaling:** Fixed vertical stacking of slides in the HTML generator and added auto-scaling to fit the viewer's viewport dimensions.
- **Chat Error Handling:** Implemented deduplication for session error messages to prevent repeated bubbles during stream failures.
- **Linux UI Transparency:** Fixed an issue where the project switcher dropdown was unreadable on Linux due to incorrect glass effect rendering.
- **Session Loading:** Resolved a bug where the application would start with a blank screen instead of loading the previously selected chat session.
- **External Link Handling:** Fixed permission issues preventing "Open in Browser" from working for generated files.
- **HTML Preview:** Links within generated HTML reports now correctly open in the system default browser.
- **Tool Selector Cleanup:** Temporarily disabled the unimplemented "Diagrams" and "Tables" categories from the specialized tools selector to improve UX.
- Robust cancellation: Stop button now reliably terminates backend AI processes using a fallback API mechanism.
- Tool visibility: All tool calls (including technical ones) are now visible throughout the session per user request.
- Fixed chat "freezing" by ensuring intermediate reasoning and tool steps are always streamed to the UI.
- Replaced hardcoded version numbers with dynamic values in `MatrixLoader`, `Settings`, and the initial splash screen.
- Improved error handling in the sidecar manager when primary cancellation endpoints are unavailable.
- Resolved ESLint warnings in `Message.tsx` and `Chat.tsx`.

### Changed

- Updated `create_session` and `rewind_to_message` to include default safe-tool permissions.
- Modified `sidecar.rs` to treat "reasoning" parts as visible content.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-01-20

### Added

- Compact theme selector dropdown with theme details and color swatches.
- Active provider/model badge next to the tool selector in chat.
- Allow-all toggle for tool permissions on new chats.

### Fixed

- Linux `.deb` auto-update now downloads the `.deb` artifact (instead of the AppImage), preventing `update is not a valid deb package`.
- Taskbar no longer overlays the About and Settings screens.
- OpenCode sidecar API compatibility after upstream route changes (provider/model listing and prompt submission).
- Streaming event parsing for newer OpenCode SSE payload shapes.
- Structured provider errors now surface in the chat UI instead of failing silently; improved extraction of specific reasons (e.g., credit limits) from nested responses.
- Permission prompts now render correctly for updated tool event payloads.
- Provider key status refreshes immediately after saving or deleting API keys.
- Technical tool calls (edit, write, ls, etc.) are now handled as transient background tasks and auto-cleanup from chat on success.
- Final AI responses now render reliably at the end of a session, with an automatic backfill mechanism if the stream is interrupted.
- Reduced terminal log spam by downgrading verbose background activity and summarizing large event payloads.
- Fixed a TypeScript error where the `tool` property was missing from the `tool_end` event payload.

### Changed

- Update checking and install progress is now shown at the top of Settings.
