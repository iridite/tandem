# Tandem Launch Thread for X/Twitter

---

## Tweet 1 — HOOK (attach `app7.png` — the dashboard)

🚀 Launching **Tandem** — an open-source AI coworker for your desktop.

Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/macOS). Privacy-first. BYOK.

It reads your project files. Proposes changes. Generates artifacts.

Built with @taaborea (Tauri) + OpenCode.

🧵👇

## Tweet 2 — THE PROBLEM (attach `app2.png` — Plan Mode)

Most AI coding tools let the agent "run wild."

Tandem flips that:
→ AI proposes changes as a task list
→ You review diffs side-by-side
→ Batch execute when ready

**You stay in control.**

---

## Tweet 3 — ARTIFACTS (attach `app7.png` or `app8.png` — dashboard)

The real wow: **Artifacts.**

Ask for a report → get an interactive HTML dashboard with Chart.js.

Preview it right inside the app. Export when ready.

Not just chat. _Visible outputs._

---

## Tweet 4 — PPTX (attach `app3.png` — slides preview)

Same for presentations.

AI generates structured slides → preview with thumbnails → one-click Export to PPTX.

No more copy-pasting into Google Slides.

---

## Tweet 5 — BYOK (attach `app5.png` — providers list)

Bring your own keys:
• OpenRouter (100+ models)
• Anthropic (Claude)
• OpenAI (GPT-4)
• Ollama (local, no API key)

Pick what works for you. No vendor lock-in.

---

## Tweet 6 — SECURITY (attach `app6.png` — vault PIN)

Zero telemetry. Local-first.

Your API keys live in an encrypted vault (AES-256-GCM).

Your data only goes to the LLM provider _you_ chose.

---

## Tweet 7 — POSITIONING + LINKS (attach `app.png` — clean hero)

If you've seen Anthropic's "Claude Cowork" — Tandem is the open-source alternative.

✅ Cross-platform (not macOS-only)
✅ Provider-agnostic (not locked to Claude)
✅ MIT licensed

## Tweet 8 — CTA (no image, or reuse `app7.png`)

What should I demo first?

• "PDF folder → synthesized report"
• "Incident logs → timeline + postmortem"
• "Requirements doc → implementation plan"

Reply with your pick 👇

# Notes

**Thread length:** 8 tweets (can trim to 7 by combining 5+6)

**Lead image:** `app7.png` is crucial — it's the visual hook. Dashboard + chat split-screen = instant "wow."

**Hashtags (optional, add to Tweet 1):**
#buildinpublic #opensource #ai #tauri

**Tagging:**
