# Tweet Thread: Pack Showcase

**Tweet 1 (The Hook - Day 1 Preview):**

🧵 Developer tools gave programmers superpowers in 2024.

Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot—AI that understands entire projects, makes changes across hundreds of files, lets you review everything.

But why should only devs have these tools?

**Tweet 2 (The Problem):**

Most AI tools trap you in a "chat bubble":
- One file at a time
- One question at a time
- No folder-wide context
- Your data goes to the cloud

Researchers with 200 PDFs? Stuck uploading one by one.
Writers with 50 chapters? No consistency checking.
Analysts with quarterly reports? Manual pattern hunting.
