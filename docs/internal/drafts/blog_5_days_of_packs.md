# 5 Days of Tandem Packs: Superpowers for Everyone

*Part 1 of our Starter Pack Showcase Series*

---

Last year, AI coding tools changed everything for developers. Cursor, Claude Code, and Copilot gave programmers superpowers: folder-wide context, multi-file edits, and AI that understands entire projects.

But here's what struck me: **non-developers have the exact same needs.**

A researcher with 200 PDFs needs cross-document synthesis. A writer with a 50-chapter manuscript needs consistency across every chapter. An analyst with quarterly reports needs pattern recognition across dozens of files.

These people deserve the same tools.

**That's why we built Tandem Packs.**

## What Are Tandem Packs?

Think of them as reusable AI workflows—ready-made templates that demonstrate Tandem's capabilities while giving you a head start on common tasks.

Each pack includes:
- Curated input materials (documents, code, research papers)
- Step-by-step prompts that guide Tandem through the workflow
- Expected outputs so you know what you're building toward

## The Starter Pack Collection

Over the next 5 days, we'll explore each pack in depth:

### Day 1: Research Synthesis Pack
Turn 12 conflicting research papers into a single, coherent dashboard—with citations and a claims matrix. Perfect for academics, analysts, and anyone drowning in research.

### Day 2: Micro-Drama Script Studio Pack
Write a complete short-form video script with structured beats, character sheets, and a visual writer's room dashboard. Ideal for content creators and storytellers.

### Day 3: Web Starter Audit Pack
Automatically audit a web project for accessibility, code quality, and security issues—then generate a professional HTML audit report. Essential for developers and QA engineers.

### Day 4: Security Playbook Pack
Build a comprehensive security runbook for your team, complete with threat assessments, compliance mappings, and incident response procedures. A must for security-conscious teams.

### Day 5: Web Research Refresh Pack
Take stale documentation and transform it into verified, cited, up-to-date resources using authoritative sources. Invaluable for technical writers and documentation teams.

## Why This Matters

Most AI tools trap you in a "chat bubble"—one file at a time, one question at a time, context-free.

Tandem works differently. It understands your entire workspace. It can read 100 files, synthesize them, and produce a polished report. All while keeping your data on your machine.

And with Packs, you don't start from scratch. Someone (maybe us, maybe the community) has already figured out the workflow. You just run it.
