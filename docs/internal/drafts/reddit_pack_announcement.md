## Body

Hey everyone!

I've been building **Tandem**, a local-first AI workspace that keeps your data on your machine while giving you powerful AI capabilities.

To help people get started quickly, I created **5 Tandem Packs**—ready-made workflows that showcase what Tandem can do while giving you a head start on common tasks.

---

## 🎬 What Are Tandem Packs?

Think of them as reusable AI templates. Each pack includes:
- Curated input materials (documents, code, research papers)
- Step-by-step prompts that guide Tandem through the workflow
- Expected outputs so you know what you're building toward

---

## 📚 Pack 1: Research Synthesis Pack

**Turn 10 conflicting research papers into one coherent dashboard.**

This pack includes 10 synthetic research papers on "Local-First AI in Regulated Environments"—they disagree on key points, just like real research.

What you'll build:
- Claims/evidence matrix with citations
- Conflict analysis across sources
- Executive summary for stakeholders
- Interactive HTML research dashboard

**Perfect for**: Researchers, analysts, knowledge workers

---

## 🎬 Pack 2: Micro-Drama Script Studio Pack

**Write a complete short-form video script with structured beats.**

What you'll build:
- Episode premise options with loglines
- Beat sheet with scene breakdowns
- Full script in proper format
- Writer's room visual dashboard

**Perfect for**: Content creators, storytellers, video producers

---

## 🔍 Pack 3: Web Starter Audit Pack

**Audit web projects for code quality and accessibility—automatically.**

This pack includes a mini web project with intentional issues (accessibility bugs, code quality problems, etc.).

What you'll build:
- Comprehensive audit findings
- Prioritized remediation plan
- Before/after changelog
- Professional HTML audit report

**Perfect for**: Developers, QA engineers, technical leads

---

## 🛡️ Pack 4: Security Playbook Pack

**Build a complete security runbook for your team.**

This pack includes fictional company context, team profile, threat landscape, and compliance requirements.

What you'll build:
- Threat assessment matrix
- Priority security checklist
- Team-specific runbook
- Interactive security dashboard

**Perfect for**: Security teams, DevOps leads, small organizations

---

## 🔄 Pack 5: Web Research Refresh Pack

**Take stale documentation and turn it into verified, cited, up-to-date resources.**

This pack includes a deliberately outdated brief with claims from January 2024—and a list of facts to verify.

What you'll build:
- Claims inventory from stale docs
- Evidence log with source citations
- Updated facts sheet
- Citable HTML research report

**Perfect for**: Technical writers, documentation teams, fact-checkers

---

## 🔒 Privacy-First, Always

All packs run 100% locally:
- Your files never leave your machine
- Zero telemetry, no tracking
- Bring your own API key (OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, or Ollama)
- Pay pennies, not $20/month subscriptions

---

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the workspace packs repo
git clone https://github.com/frumu-ai/tandem

# Open Tandem, select a pack folder, and start exploring
```

Each pack has a `pack-docs/` folder with step-by-step prompts. Just follow along!

## Why I Built This

I loved what Anthropic's Claude Cowork showed about collaborative AI. But I wanted something:
- Open-source (MIT licensed)
- Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac)
- Provider-agnostic (your API key, your choice)
- Privacy-absolute (no telemetry, no cloud uploads)

Tandem Packs are my way of showing what's possible—and giving everyone a starting point.

Happy to answer questions about any of the packs! 🚀

## Suggested Follow-up Comments (Prepare in Advance)

**If asked about Claude Cowork comparison:**
> We were heavily inspired by Claude Cowork! The key difference is Tandem is open-source, cross-platform, and works with any AI provider (Ollama, OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI).

**If asked about cost:**
> You bring your own API key. With OpenRouter, I pay pennies per query. Or go 100% local with Ollama (free, but needs decent hardware).

**If asked about technical requirements:**
> Tandem is a Tauri v2 desktop app (React frontend, Rust backend). Runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Check the repo for requirements.

**If asked about creating custom packs:**
> Packs are easy to create—just add inputs and prompts! I'm planning a guide on creating custom workflows.
