# Tandem v0.1.8 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **macOS Styling Polish**: Refined the global glass effect and UI variables for a more sophisticated, premium look and feel on macOS.

# Tandem v0.1.7 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Dynamic Ollama Support**: Implemented zero-config model discovery for Ollama. Tandem now automatically detects your local models and configures the sidecar on-the-fly, so "Ollama (Local)" works instantly for all users.
- **Improved Chat Rendering**: Fixed a bug where normal text was being incorrectly identified as file paths. The chat UI is now significantly more robust and no longer produces "jarbled" clickable words.
- **Model Selection UX**: The provider/model selector has been streamlined to prioritize OpenCode Zen and Ollama, while automatically hiding unconfigured providers to reduce list noise.
- **Instant Settings Sync**: Changing your preferred model or provider in Settings now updates the Chat interface immediately without requiring a refresh.
- **Mid-Stream Permissions**: The "Allow All" button is now unblocked during generation, AND the auto-approval logic has been fixed to reliably intercept and approve tool requests without prompting.
- **Robust Session Visibility**: Session filtering is now smarter about path normalization, ensuring your chat history is complete for the active project while correctly hiding unrelated sessions.
- **HTML Slide Improvements**: Enhanced PDF export fidelity for slides and improved the flexible feedback loop during presentation planning.

## Notes

- This update focuses heavily on refining the "first-run" and "configured" experience, removing friction when selecting models and authorizing actions.

# Tandem v0.1.6 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Canvas Feature**: Securely render LLM-generated HTML reports and dashboards in a sandboxed iframe. Built-in support for Tailwind CSS, Chart.js, and Font Awesome via CDN allows the AI to create rich, interactive visual artifacts directly in the preview.
- **Improved Web Research**: Introduced a dedicated "Research" tool category. The AI now follows a smarter "Search → Select → Fetch" workflow, reducing failures and avoiding anti-bot blocks on popular sites.
- **Reasoning & Tool Visibility**: AI "thinking" steps (reasoning) are now visible in real-time and saved in chat history. Technical tool calls are no longer hidden, providing full transparency into the AI's internal logic and progress.
- **Robust Stop Command**: Fixed a critical issue where the "Stop" button failed to halt the backend process. Implemented a fallback cancellation mechanism to ensure provider API calls are terminated immediately, preventing credit waste.
- **Session Persistence**: Your active chat session now survives application reloads and rebuilds. No more losing your place or accidentally creating "New Chat" sessions on refresh.
- **Dynamic Versioning**: Hardcoded version numbers have been removed. The loading screen, splash screen, and settings now dynamically display the actual version of Tandem and the OpenCode sidecar.
- **Optimized Permissions**: Safe, non-destructive tools (listing files, reading code, searching the web) are now allowed by default. This reduces permission fatigue while keeping destructive actions (writing, deleting, commands) securely gated.

## Notes

- The Canvas feature is most reliable in **Plan Mode**, allowing you to review the proposed report structure before the AI writes the HTML file.
- If a web fetch fails due to bot detection, the AI is now instructed to pivot to alternative sources rather than retrying the same blocked URL.

# Tandem v0.1.5 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **OpenCode API Compatibility**: Sidecar requests now align with the latest OpenCode routes, restoring provider/model listings and prompt delivery after upstream changes.
- **Error Surfacing**: Structured provider errors (like OpenRouter credit limits) are now displayed directly in the chat UI with improved extraction of specific error reasons.
- **Permission Prompts**: Tool permission requests are displayed correctly again after upstream event schema changes.
- **Transient Tool UI**: Technical background tasks (file reads, edits, etc.) now appear briefly in the chat and clear automatically on success, keeping the conversation focused.
- **Reliable Responses**: Improved the synchronization of final message parts and added a history backfill mechanism to ensure responses appear correctly without needing to switch sessions.
- **Log Spam Reduction**: Terminal output is now significantly quieter, summarizing large data payloads and hiding routine background activity.
- **Settings Update UX**: Update checking and download/install progress is now surfaced at the top of Settings.
- **UI Fixes + Polish**: The taskbar no longer overlays the About/Settings screens, the theme picker is now a compact dropdown with previews, and the active provider/model badge appears next to the tool selector.
- **Allow-All Mode**: New chats can opt into an “Allow all tools” mode to skip per-tool approval prompts.

## Notes

- If you see OpenRouter credit-limit errors, add credits or lower max output tokens for the selected model.
- AppImage installs are unchanged and continue to update via the AppImage artifact.

# Tandem v0.1.1 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Enhanced Image Handling**: Implemented automatic 1024px resizing and JPEG compression, reducing image token size by up to 90%.

## Complete Feature List

### Image Pipeline (Optimization update)

- **Smart Compression**: Pasted images are automatically converted to JPEG (0.8 quality) to minimize base64 payload size.
- **Auto-Resizing**: Images larger than 1024px are capped while preserving aspect ratio, preventing "max tokens" errors in long chats.

### Platform Compatibility

- **Linux Clipboard**: Integration with `@tauri-apps/plugin-clipboard-manager` to handle screenshots and images when standard web events fail.
