# Tandem v0.2.23 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Project-scoped orchestrator context**: Fixed Orchestrator mode reopening a stale run from a different project/workspace.
- **Clean project switching behavior**: Switching or adding projects now clears stale orchestrator run selection so each workspace starts from the correct context.
- **Safer default resume logic**: Opening Orchestrator with no explicit run now auto-resumes only active runs and does not auto-open completed/terminal history.
- **Persistent orchestrator console history**: Orchestrator Console logs now reload correctly after closing/reopening the drawer, including task-session tool calls.
- **Clear runtime visibility**: Added global activity badges and per-session running indicators so concurrent chat + orchestrator work is visible at a glance.
- **Actionable failure feedback**: Retry/restart failures now surface directly in Orchestrator UI with specific reason text (for example model/provider resolution errors).
- **User-adjustable orchestrator budgets**: Added in-panel controls to increase budget headroom or relax caps so long-running runs can continue without starting over.
- **Reduced warning noise**: Repetitive orchestrator budget warnings are now throttled to prevent log spam.

## Complete Feature List

### Orchestrator

- Clear `currentOrchestratorRunId` and close stale orchestrator panel state during project switch/add flows so previous-workspace run IDs are not carried forward.
- When entering Orchestrator without an explicit run selection, only auto-select runs in active states:
  - `planning`
  - `awaiting_approval`
  - `executing`
  - `paused`
- Avoid auto-selecting terminal/history states by default:
  - `completed`
  - `failed`
  - `cancelled`
- Added a guard to reset the selected run if it is not present in the active workspace run list.
- Fixed Orchestrator Logs drawer wiring so Console receives orchestrator session scope instead of mounting without session context.
- Console history reconstruction now aggregates run base session + task child sessions for complete persisted tool execution history.
- Console live event handling is scoped to run-related session IDs to avoid unrelated stream noise.
- Retry/restart failure reasons are now surfaced in-panel via `run_failed` handling and persisted snapshot error hydration.
- Backend failure completion now preserves concrete failed-task reason text when transitioning run status to `failed`.
- Added direct budget controls in Orchestrator UI:
  - `Add Budget Headroom` (+100 iterations, +100k tokens, +30 minutes wall time, +500 sub-agent calls)
  - `Relax Max Caps` (sets very high safety limits for extended runs)
- Extending budget limits now updates persisted run config/budget state and clears `Budget exceeded` failure state when limits are no longer exceeded, allowing resume.
- Budget warning logs are now throttled:
  - log on 5% bucket increases (80, 85, 90, ...)
  - or after cooldown (30s)
  - instead of warning every execution loop tick.

### Sessions + Chat Runtime UX

- Selecting a normal chat session now reliably exits Orchestrator view and clears stale run selection.
- Added sidebar running markers for chat sessions (`RUNNING`) and orchestrator items (`EXECUTING`/active spinner).
- Added top-right runtime badges for concurrent activity:
  - `N CHATTING`
  - `N ORCHESTRATING`
- Chat running indicators now use global sidecar stream-derived running session IDs, so indicators remain correct even when switching to a different selected session.
- Removed duplicate/overlapping spinner states in the session row to keep one clear running signal per item.

---

# Tandem v0.2.21 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Provider filtering that scales**: The model selector now uses a compact provider dropdown (`All` + visible providers) instead of horizontal scrolling chips.
- **Faster provider targeting from keyboard**: Search now supports `provider:<id-or-name>` (for example `provider:openrouter sonnet`).
- **Clearer visibility rules**: Added in-context helper copy ("Showing configured providers + local") so provider filtering behavior is explicit.
- **Better empty-state feedback**: No-result messages now explain when the active provider filter has no matching models.
- **Readable fullscreen file previews**: Fullscreen file preview now uses a stronger surface backdrop so document text stays legible across transparent/gradient themes.

## Complete Feature List

### Model Selector UX

- Replaced horizontal provider chip rail with a full-width provider dropdown to improve usability with many providers.
- Kept existing provider visibility policy (configured providers + local defaults) and surfaced that behavior in the dropdown header.
- Added resilient filter behavior so provider selection resets to `All` if a previously selected provider disappears after model reload.
- Improved no-result messaging to include provider context when filtering within a specific provider.

### Files

- Increased fullscreen file preview backdrop opacity/contrast so file text remains readable instead of blending with theme background layers.

### Search

- Added provider token parsing in model search:
  - `provider:openrouter`
  - `provider:OpenCodeZen`
- Provider token filtering composes with existing model name/id search text.

# Tandem v0.2.20 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Stream reliability foundation**: Tandem now uses a single global stream hub with one long-lived sidecar subscription, then fans events out internally to chat, orchestrator, and Ralph.
- **Modern event envelopes (backward compatible)**: Added additive `sidecar_event_v2` metadata envelopes (`event_id`, `correlation_id`, `ts_ms`, `session_id`, `source`, `payload`) while keeping legacy `sidecar_event`.
- **Smoother busy-chat UX**: Enter while generation is active now queues messages (FIFO) with queue controls to send next/all or remove items.
- **Skills import lifecycle upgrade**: Added SKILL.md/zip import preview and apply workflows with conflict policy control (`skip`, `overwrite`, `rename`) and richer metadata surfacing.

## Complete Feature List

### Streams + Reliability

- Added `stream_hub` as the centralized event substrate for app runtime streaming.
- Refactored `send_message_streaming` to send-only; stream relay now comes from shared hub.
- Migrated orchestrator and Ralph event consumption off independent sidecar subscriptions onto hub fanout.
- Added stream health signaling (`healthy`, `degraded`, `recovering`) and surfaced it in chat.
- Added frontend deterministic event dedupe keyed by `event_id` from v2 envelopes.

### Chat UX

- Added queue IPC + UI integration:
  - `queue_message`
  - `queue_list`
  - `queue_remove`
  - `queue_send_next`
  - `queue_send_all`
- Queue behavior is FIFO and supports enqueueing while the assistant is currently generating.
- Added inline queue preview controls in chat.
- Added missing `memory_retrieval` stream handling path in chat.
- Improved inline process/tool summary cards with compact status and counts.

### Skills Lifecycle

- Added backend APIs:
  - `skills_import_preview(fileOrPath, location, namespace?, conflictPolicy)`
  - `skills_import(fileOrPath, location, namespace?, conflictPolicy)`
- Added zip-pack SKILL discovery and preview summary before apply.
- Added deterministic conflict handling policies: `skip`, `overwrite`, `rename`.
- Added namespaced import-path support for better organization.
- Expanded surfaced skill metadata:
  - `version`
  - `author`
  - `tags`
  - `requires`
  - `compatibility`
  - `triggers`
- Improved invalid-skill parse feedback in installed skills UX.

# Tandem v0.2.19 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Verifiable memory retrieval**: Chat now executes vector retrieval before prompt send, emits telemetry, and shows a per-response memory badge in chat.
- **Cleaner diagnostics UX**: Logs drawer now separates Tandem logs and Console activity, and fullscreen log height scales dynamically.
- **Sidecar lifecycle hardening**: Start/stop transitions are serialized to prevent duplicate OpenCode/Bun process spawns.
- **Pink Pony readability pass**: Theme contrast/surface opacity tuned for better legibility against bright gradients.
- **Chat Performance**: Long chat sessions now render smoothly thanks to new list virtualization and optimization.

## Complete Feature List

### Memory + Chat

- Run memory retrieval in both send paths (`send_message`, `send_message_streaming`) before forwarding to sidecar.
- Emit `memory_retrieval` stream events with:
  - `used`
  - `chunks_total`
  - `session_chunks`
  - `history_chunks`
  - `project_fact_chunks`
  - `latency_ms`
  - `query_hash` (short SHA-256 prefix)
  - `score_min` / `score_max`
- Inject formatted `<memory_context>` above user content only when retrieval returns context.
- Show assistant-side memory capsule with a brain icon:
  - `Memory: X chunks (Yms)` when used
  - `Memory: not used` when skipped or empty

### Logging + Console

- Route memory telemetry through a distinct `tandem.memory` logging target for easier log filtering/scanning.
- Keep telemetry privacy-safe (no raw user query text, no chunk content/body logging).
- Remove redundant OC sidecar tab from the log viewer and use Console tab for command/tool activity.
- Fix log drawer fullscreen sizing so list height re-measures on resize and tab/expand changes.

### Sidecar Reliability

- Add sidecar lifecycle serialization lock to prevent concurrent start/stop races that could spawn duplicate OpenCode/Bun processes.

### Themes

- Improve Pink Pony readability with higher-contrast text, stronger surface opacity, and clearer borders/glass values.

### Performance

- **Chat Virtualization**: Implemented list virtualization for the chat interface, ensuring O(1) rendering performance regardless of message history length.
- **Component Memoization**: Optimized message rendering to prevent unnecessary re-renders during typing and streaming.
- **Build Reliability**: Fixed strict TypeScript errors in the Logs Drawer to ensure clean production builds.

# Tandem v0.2.18 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Workspace Python venv enforcement**: Venv-only python/pip policy now applies consistently, including staged/batch execution, and the Python Setup wizard auto-opens when Python is blocked.
- **Python pack hygiene**: Python packs ship `requirements.txt` and venv-first docs (no more encouraging global `pip install`).
- **Better file previews**: File preview supports a dock mount + fullscreen toggle.

## Work In Progress / Known Issues

- **Files Auto-Refresh (WIP)**: The Files tree does not reliably refresh when tools/AI create new files in the workspace. Deeper investigation needed; workaround is to navigate away and back to Files.

## Complete Feature List

### Python

- Enforce venv-only python/pip usage across approval flows and staged/batch execution.
- Auto-open the Python Setup (Workspace Venv) wizard when Python is blocked by policy.
- Add a shared policy helper + tests for consistent enforcement across tool approval paths.

### Packs

- Data Visualization + Finance Analysis packs ship `requirements.txt`.
- Pack docs are venv-first (install via `.opencode/.venv`).
- Packs can include a pack-level `CONTRIBUTING.md` which is installed alongside `START_HERE.md`.

### Files

- File preview supports a dock mount + fullscreen toggle.

# Tandem v0.2.17 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Custom Background Opacity Slider Fix**: Fix opacity changes causing the background image to flash or disappear in bundled builds by keeping the resolved image URL stable and updating only opacity.
- **Reliable Background Layering**: Render the custom background image as a dedicated fixed layer for consistent stacking across views.

---

# Tandem v0.2.16 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Update Prompt Layout Fix**: Fix the in-app update prompt becoming constrained/squished due to theme background layering CSS.

---

# Tandem v0.2.15 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Custom Background Loading Fix**: Fix custom background images failing to load after updating in some packaged builds by falling back to an in-memory `data:` URL when the `asset:` URL fails.

---

# Tandem v0.2.14 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Theme Background Art Pass**: Cosmic Glass (starfield + galaxy glow), Pink Pony (thick arcing rainbow), and Zen Dusk (minimalist ink + sage haze).
- **Custom Background Image Overlay**: Choose a background image (copied into app data) and overlay it on top of the active theme, with an opacity slider in Settings.
- **Settings/About/Extensions Restored**: Fix a regression where Settings/About/Extensions views would not appear.
- **Document Text Extraction (Rust)**: PDF/DOCX/PPTX/XLSX (and more) can now be extracted to plain text for preview and for attaching to skills/chats, without requiring Python.
- **Python Venv Wizard + Safety Enforcement**: In-app wizard creates `.opencode/.venv` per workspace and installs dependencies into it; AI tool calls are blocked from running global `pip install` or `python` outside the venv.
- **Startup Session Restore Fix**: Restored sessions now open reliably on startup (no need to reselect a session).

---

# Tandem v0.2.13 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **New Starter Skills**: Add two new bundled starter skills: `brainstorming` and `development-estimation`.
- **Runtime Requirement Pills**: Starter skill cards can show optional runtime hints (Python/Node/Bash) via `requires: [...]` YAML frontmatter.
- **Skills UX Improvements**: Clearer install/manage experience (runtime note, installed-skill counts, and better discoverability of deletion).
- **Packs Page Cleanup**: Packs page now shows packs only (no starter skills section) and surfaces the runtime note at the top.
- **Diagnostics Polishing**: Logs viewer improvements (fullscreen + copy feedback) and fix invalid bundled skill template frontmatter so templates aren’t skipped.
- **Dev Quality of Life**: In `tauri dev`, starter skill templates are loaded from `src-tauri/resources/skill-templates/` so newly added templates appear immediately.

---

# Tandem v0.2.12 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Orchestrator Model Routing Fix**: Orchestrator runs persist the selected provider/model and always send prompts with an explicit model spec, avoiding "unknown" run model and preventing runs that never reach the provider.
- **Orchestrator Restart/Retries**: Prevent Restart/Retry from claiming "Completed" without doing any work by guarding against empty plans and allowing completed runs to rerun the full plan.
- **Delete Orchestrator Runs**: Orchestrator runs can now be deleted from the Sessions sidebar (removes the run from disk and deletes its backing OpenCode session).
- **Better In-App Log Sharing**: The Logs drawer supports horizontal scroll for long lines, plus selected-line preview and one-click copy helpers.
- **Release to Discord Notifications**: Automated releases now post to Discord reliably (publishing via `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not trigger separate `release: published` workflows).

---

# Tandem v0.2.11 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **No More Stuck "Pending Tool" Runs**: Prevent sessions from hanging indefinitely when an OpenCode tool invocation never reaches a terminal state. Tandem now ignores heartbeat/diff noise, recognizes more tool terminal statuses, and fail-fast cancels the request with a visible error after a timeout.
- **On-Demand Log Streaming Viewer**: A new Logs side drawer can tail Tandem's own app logs and show OpenCode sidecar stdout/stderr (captured safely into a bounded in-memory buffer). It only streams while open to avoid baseline performance cost.
- **Orchestrator Model Routing Fix**: Orchestrator runs now persist the selected provider/model and always send prompts with an explicit model spec, avoiding "unknown" run model and preventing runs that never reach the provider.
- **Cleaner Logs**: OpenCode `server.*` heartbeat SSE events are ignored (and other unknown SSE events are downgraded) to prevent warning spam.
- **Poe Provider**: Add Poe as an OpenAI-compatible provider option (endpoint + `POE_API_KEY`). Thanks [@CamNoob](https://github.com/CamNoob).
- **Release Pipeline Resilience**: GitHub Release asset uploads now retry to reduce flakes during transient GitHub errors.

_Note: v0.2.10 was a failed release attempt due to a GitHub incident during asset upload; v0.2.11 is the re-cut._

---

# Tandem v0.2.10 Release Notes

## Highlights

_Release attempt failed on 2026-02-09 due to GitHub release asset upload errors during a GitHub incident; no assets were published._

---

# Tandem v0.2.9 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Project File Indexing**: Incremental per-project workspace file indexing with total/percent progress, plus All Projects vs Active Project stats scope and a "Clear File Index" action (optional VACUUM) to reclaim space.
- **Question Prompts**: Properly handle OpenCode `question.asked` events (including multi-question requests) and show an interactive one-at-a-time wizard with multiple-choice + custom answers; replies are sent via the OpenCode reply API.
- **Startup Session History**: When Tandem restores the last active folder on launch, it now loads that folder's session history automatically (no more empty sidebar until a manual refresh).
- **Windows Dev Reload Sidecar Cleanup**: Prevent orphaned OpenCode sidecar (and Bun) processes during `pnpm tauri dev` rebuilds by attaching the sidecar to a Windows Job Object (kill-on-close).

---

# Tandem v0.2.8 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Multi Custom Providers (OpenCode)**: Select any provider from the OpenCode sidecar catalog, including user-defined providers by name in `.opencode/config.json`.
- **Model Selection Routing**: Persist the selected `provider_id` + `model_id` and prefer it when sending messages, so switching to non-standard providers actually takes effect.

---

# Tandem v0.2.7 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **OpenCode Config Safety**: Prevent OpenCode config writes from deleting an existing `opencode.json` when replacement fails (e.g. file locked on Windows).
- **Sidecar Idle Memory**: Set Bun/JSC memory env hints to reduce excessive idle memory usage.

---

# Tandem v0.2.6 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **macOS Release Builds**: Disabled signing/notarization by default to prevent macOS build failures when Apple certificate secrets are missing or misconfigured. (Enable with `MACOS_SIGNING_ENABLED=true`.)

---

# Tandem v0.2.5 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Release Build Trigger**: Re-cut release so GitHub Actions builds run with the corrected release workflow configuration.

---

# Tandem v0.2.4 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Starter Pack Installs Fixed**: Starter Packs and Starter Skills now install correctly from packaged builds (bundled resource path resolution).
- **Custom Provider Onboarding**: Custom endpoints (e.g. LM Studio / OpenAI-compatible) are treated as configured, so onboarding no longer forces you back to Settings.
- **Vector DB Stats**: New Settings panel to track vector DB size/chunks and manually index your workspace (with progress).
- **macOS Release Hardening**: Release workflow now supports optional signing/notarization inputs and runs Gatekeeper verification in CI.

## Complete Feature List

### Starter Packs & Skills

- Fix bundled pack/template discovery in production builds so installs work reliably.
- Show more actionable pack install errors in the UI.

### Onboarding

- Treat enabled Custom providers with an endpoint as “configured” to avoid onboarding loops.

### Memory

- Add a Vector DB stats card in Settings.
- Add manual “Index Files” action with progress events and indexing summary.

### Release / CI

- Add Gatekeeper verification of produced macOS DMGs (`codesign`, `spctl`, `stapler validate`).
- Add optional Apple signing/notarization inputs to the GitHub release workflow.

---

# Tandem v0.2.3 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Orchestration Session Spam Fix**: Orchestration Mode no longer creates an endless stream of new root chat sessions while running tasks. Internal task/resume sessions are now treated as child sessions and the session list prefers root sessions only.

## Complete Feature List

### Orchestration

- Prevent internal orchestration task/resume sessions from flooding the main session history.

---

---

# Tandem v0.2.1 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **First-outcome onboarding**: a guided wizard helps new users pick a folder, connect AI, and run a starter workflow in minutes.
- **Starter Packs + Starter Skills (offline)**: install curated, local-first templates directly from the app—no copy/paste required (advanced SKILL.md paste remains available).
- **More reliable Orchestration**: runs now pause on provider quota/rate-limit errors so you can switch model/provider and resume, instead of failing after max retries.

## Complete Feature List

### UX

- Onboarding wizard to drive a “first successful outcome”.
- Packs panel for browsing and installing bundled workflow packs.
- Starter Skills gallery with a clear separation between templates and “Advanced: paste SKILL.md”.
- Reduced developer-jargon in key surfaces to better match a non-coder-first product.

### Orchestration

- Increased default iteration/sub-agent budgets and auto-upgraded older runs created with too-low limits.
- Provider quota/rate-limit detection now pauses runs (and avoids burning retries), enabling recovery without restarting from scratch.
- Model selection is available even after a run fails to support “switch and resume”.

### Platform / Reliability

- Provider env vars are explicitly synced/removed and sidecar restarts correctly apply config changes.

### Contributors

- Added top-level product docs (`VISION.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, `PRINCIPLES.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`).

- CI now fails on frontend lint instead of ignoring violations.

---

# Tandem v0.2.0 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration (Phase 1)**: The biggest update to Tandem yet. We've introduced a dedicated Orchestration Mode that coordinates specialized AI agents to solve complex, multi-step problems together. Instead of a single chat loop, Tandem now builds a plan, delegates tasks to "Builder" and "Validator" agents, and manages the entire process with a visual Kanban board.
- **Unified Sidebar**: We've simplified navigation by merging standard Chat Sessions and Orchestrator Runs into a single, unified list. Your entire history is now organized chronologically under smart project headers, so you never lose track of a context.

## Complete Feature List

### Orchestration

- **DAG Execution Engine**: Tasks are no longer linear. The orchestrator manages dependencies, allowing independent tasks to run in parallel.
- **Specialized Sub-Agents**:
  - **Planner**: Breaks down objectives into executable steps.
  - **Builder**: Writes code and applies patches.
  - **Validator**: Runs tests and verifies acceptance criteria.
- **Safety First**: New policy engine enforces distinct permission tiers for reading vs. writing vs. web access.
- **Budget Controls**: Hard limits on tokens, time, and iterations prevent runaway costs.

### UX Improvements

- **Unified Session List**: A cleaner, more organized sidebar that handles both Chat and Orchestrator contexts seamlessly.
- **Real-time Status**: See at a glance which runs are completed, failed, or still in progress directly from the sidebar.

---

# Tandem v0.1.15 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Unified Update Experience**: We've completely overhauled how updates are handled. Previously, the application and the local AI engine (sidecar) had separate, disjointed update screens. Now, they share a unified, polished full-screen interface that communicates progress clearly and resolves scheduling conflicts.

## Complete Feature List

### UX Improvements

- **Unified Update UI**: A shared visual component now powers the "checking", "downloading", and "installing" states for all types of updates.
- **Blocking Update Overlay**: Critical updates for the app now present a prominent, focused overlay that can't be missed, ensuring you're always on the latest version.
- **Conflict Management**: Smart layering ensures that if both an app update and an AI engine update are available, the app update (which requires a restart) takes priority to prevent corrupted states.

---

# Tandem v0.1.14 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Task Completion Relaibility**: We've tightened the feedback loop between the AI's work and the UI. Now, when Ralph Loop or Plan Mode executes a task, it is explicitly instructed to mark that task as "completed" in your list using the `todowrite` tool. This fixes the annoying desync where the AI would finish the work but leave the checkbox empty.
- **Smarter Execution Prompts**: The automated prompts used during plan execution have been refined to ensure the AI understands exactly how to report its progress back to the interface.

## Complete Change List

### Core Intelligence

- **Prompt Engineering**: Updated `ralph/service.rs` and `Chat.tsx` to include strict directives for task status updates. The AI is now mandated to call `todowrite` with `status="completed"` immediately after finishing a task item.

- **Ralph Loop (Iterative Task Agent)**: Meet Ralph—a new mode that puts the AI in a robust "do-loop." Give it a complex task, and it will iterate, verify, and refine its work until it meets a strict completion promise. It's like having a tireless junior developer who checks their own work.
- **Long-Term Memory**: Tandem now remembers! We've integrated a semantic memory system using `sqlite-vec` that allows the AI to recall context from previous sessions and project documents. This means smarter, more context-aware assistance that grows with your project.
- **Semantic Context Retrieval**: Questions about your project now tap into a vector database of your codebase, providing accurate, relevant context even for large repositories that don't fit in a standard prompt.

## Complete Feature List

### Core Intelligence

- **Vector Memory Store**: Implemented a local, zero-trust vector database (`sqlite-vec`) to store and retrieve semantic embeddings of your codebase and conversation history.
- **Memory Context Injection**: The AI now automatically receives relevant context snippets based on your current query, reducing hallucinations and "I don't know" responses about your own code.
