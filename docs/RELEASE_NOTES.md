# Tandem v0.1.14 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Long-Term Memory**: Tandem now remembers! We've integrated a semantic memory system using `sqlite-vec` that allows the AI to recall context from previous sessions and project documents. This means smarter, more context-aware assistance that grows with your project.
- **Ralph Loop (Iterative Task Agent)**: Meet Ralph—a new mode that puts the AI in a robust "do-loop." Give it a complex task, and it will iterate, verify, and refine its work until it meets a strict completion promise. It's like having a tireless junior developer who checks their own work.
- **Semantic Context Retrieval**: Questions about your project now tap into a vector database of your codebase, providing accurate, relevant context even for large repositories that don't fit in a standard prompt.

## Complete Feature List

### Core Intelligence

- **Vector Memory Store**: Implemented a local, zero-trust vector database (`sqlite-vec`) to store and retrieve semantic embeddings of your codebase and conversation history.
- **Memory Context Injection**: The AI now automatically receives relevant context snippets based on your current query, reducing hallucinations and "I don't know" responses about your own code.

### Workflow

- **Iterative Execution Loop**: The new "Ralph Loop" mode automates the [Plan -> Execute -> Verify] cycle. It loops until the task is verifiable complete, with built-in pause/resume controls for human oversight.
- **Plan Mode Integration**: Ralph works hand-in-hand with Plan Mode, respecting your review process while automating the repetitive parts of implementation.

### Technical improvements

- **SQLite Extension Fix**: Resolved a critical build issue with `sqlite-vec` by properly registering the C-extension initialization, ensuring stable memory database connections.
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive documentation for the Ralph Loop architecture and implementation details.

# Tandem v0.1.13 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Native Planning Mode**: A powerful new agent mode for drafting architecture and implementation plans. No more jumping into code blindly—the AI now proposes a markdown-based plan for you to review and approve first.
- **Real-time Plan Synchronization**: Your UI is now a live reflection of your plan files. Changes made by the AI (or you) to plan files are immediately detected and reflected in the chat, thanks to a new backend watcher.
- **Clarification Buttons**: Interactive follow-up questions from the AI now appear with clickable suggestion buttons, making it easier to provide quick feedback on technical decisions.
- **Backend Stability**: Fixed the `get_workspace_path` compilation error that plagued the recent development cycle.

## Complete Feature List

### Planning

- **Plan Agent Skill**: Optimized prompt engineering to force structured, question-free plan generation.
- **Plan Viewer & Selector**: New UI components for navigating and reviewing plans created during the session.
- **Synchronized Backend Watcher**: Tauri-backed filesystem notifications for the plans directory.
- **Interactive Questions**: Support for `ask_followup_question` with structured options in the chat interface.

### Technical improvements

- **Whitespace Enforcement**: Tightened tool call parsing to eliminate errors caused by leading/trailing spaces in tool names.
- **Strict Context Injection**: Dynamic system directives that prime the AI with the correct plan file path and immediate goals.
- **Code Health**: Cleaned up various linting and formatting warnings across the Rust and TypeScript codebases.

# Tandem v0.1.12 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **File Viewer Fixed**: Resolved "Failed to load directory" error that broke the Files tab. The overly restrictive path security checks from v0.1.11 were causing Windows path normalization issues and have been removed.
- **Permission Spam Fix**: Stopped repeated approval prompts for the same tool request, even when "Allow all" is enabled.
- **Reliable Auto-Approval**: Auto-approve now responds to the correct permission request ID and no longer creates duplicate prompts.
- **Cleaner Session Switching**: Pending approvals reset cleanly when switching sessions to prevent stale prompts.

## Complete Fix List

### File Access

- **Directory Loading**: Removed path allowlist checks from `read_directory`, `read_file_content`, and `read_binary_file` that were causing the file viewer to fail. The canonical path normalization on Windows (e.g., `\\?\C:\...`) wasn't matching the stored allowed paths, resulting in "Failed to load directory" errors.

### Permissions

- **Deduplicated Requests**: Permission prompts are now keyed to a single request ID to prevent duplicates.
- **Allow All Alignment**: Auto-approval now uses the permission request ID instead of tool start IDs.
- **Session Reset**: Pending permissions are cleared when the active session changes.

# Tandem v0.1.11 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Version Metadata Repair**: Corrected mismatched version numbers across files (some 0.1.8/0.1.9 while the built version was 0.1.10) to restore reliable auto-update detection. If you're on v0.1.9, you should now be able to update to v0.1.11 and receive all the Skills Management features from v0.1.10.
- **Safer File Access**: Tightened file browser access to the active workspace with stronger denylist enforcement on Windows.
- **Quieter Streaming**: Removed verbose debug logs to keep the UI responsive during long streaming sessions.

## Complete Fix List

### Security & Stability

- **Workspace Allowlist Enforcement**: File browsing, text reads, and binary reads now require the path to be inside the active workspace.
- **Denylist Normalization**: Windows path separators are normalized to ensure patterns like `.env`, `.key`, and `.pem` are consistently blocked.
- **Binary Read Guardrails**: Large binary files are now blocked by default with a safe size limit.

### Performance

- **Streaming Log Reduction**: Removed high-volume stream and provider logs that could slow down the UI during generation.

## Notes

- This is a patch release to fix the v0.1.10 update detection issue. All features from v0.1.10 (Skills Management, automatic sidecar restart, etc.) are included.
- If you're manually installing, you can skip directly to v0.1.11.

---

# Tandem v0.1.7 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Dynamic Ollama Support**: Implemented zero-config model discovery for Ollama. Tandem now automatically detects your local models and configures the sidecar on-the-fly, so "Ollama (Local)" works instantly for all users.
- **Improved Chat Rendering**: Fixed a bug where normal text was being incorrectly identified as file paths. The chat UI is now significantly more robust and no longer produces "jarbled" clickable words.
- **Model Selection UX**: The provider/model selector has been streamlined to prioritize OpenCode Zen and Ollama, while automatically hiding unconfigured providers to reduce list noise.
- **Instant Settings Sync**: Changing your preferred model or provider in Settings now updates the Chat interface immediately without requiring a refresh.
- **Mid-Stream Permissions**: The "Allow All" button is now unblocked during generation, AND the auto-approval logic has been fixed to reliably intercept and approve tool requests without prompting.
- **Robust Session Visibility**: Session filtering is now smarter about path normalization, ensuring your chat history is complete for the active project while correctly hiding unrelated sessions.

# Tandem v0.1.6 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Canvas Feature**: Securely render LLM-generated HTML reports and dashboards in a sandboxed iframe. Built-in support for Tailwind CSS, Chart.js, and Font Awesome via CDN allows the AI to create rich, interactive visual artifacts directly in the preview.
- **Improved Web Research**: Introduced a dedicated "Research" tool category. The AI now follows a smarter "Search → Select → Fetch" workflow, reducing failures and avoiding anti-bot blocks on popular sites.
- **Reasoning & Tool Visibility**: AI "thinking" steps (reasoning) are now visible in real-time and saved in chat history. Technical tool calls are no longer hidden, providing full transparency into the AI's internal logic and progress.
- **Robust Stop Command**: Fixed a critical issue where the "Stop" button failed to halt the backend process. Implemented a fallback cancellation mechanism to ensure provider API calls are terminated immediately, preventing credit waste.
- **Session Persistence**: Your active chat session now survives application reloads and rebuilds. No more losing your place or accidentally creating "New Chat" sessions on refresh.
- **Dynamic Versioning**: Hardcoded version numbers have been removed. The loading screen, splash screen, and settings now dynamically display the actual version of Tandem and the OpenCode sidecar.
- **Optimized Permissions**: Safe, non-destructive tools (listing files, reading code, searching the web) are now allowed by default. This reduces permission fatigue while keeping destructive actions (writing, deleting, commands) securely gated.

## Notes

- The Canvas feature is most reliable in **Plan Mode**, allowing you to review the proposed report structure before the AI writes the HTML file.
- If a web fetch fails due to bot detection, the AI is now instructed to pivot to alternative sources rather than retrying the same blocked URL.
