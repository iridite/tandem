# Marketing Strategy: Reaching Non-Technical Users

This document outlines how to position Tandem as a productivity tool for users who are not software developers, focusing on privacy, document management, and personal intelligence.

## 1. Core Value Proposition Reframing

Shift from technical terminology to user-centric benefits.

- **Developer Focus:** "Local-first AI workspace with sidecar orchestration."
- **Consumer Focus:** "A Private AI Librarian that lives on your computer. It knows your files, but never shares your secrets."

## 2. Key Marketing Pillars

### A. Privacy-Absolute

- **The Problem:** Most AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude) upload data to the cloud for training.
- **The Tandem Solution:** Zero telemetry. Data never leaves the machine. No analytics. No "calling home."
- **Keywords:** Vault-secured, Air-gapped potential, Data Sovereignty.

### B. Folder-Wide Intelligence

- **Use Case:** Instead of "Chat with a PDF," it's "Chat with your Workspace."
- **Narrative:** "Drop 100 documents into a folder, and Tandem becomes an expert on all of them instantly."

### C. Pay-As-You-Go Economics

- **Target:** Users tired of $20/month subscriptions.
- **Narrative:** "Stop paying for AI you aren't using. Connect to OpenRouter and pay only for the questions you ask—often just pennies a month."

## 3. Targeted User Personas

| Persona                 | Use Case                                     | "Job to be Done"                                                       |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Academic Researcher** | Synthesis of hundreds of PDFs/papers.        | Find common themes and citations across a massive library.             |
| **Creative Writer**     | World-building and manuscript consistency.   | A partner that remembers every detail of your 500-page book.           |
| **Privacy Advocate**    | Working with sensitive legal/financial data. | Use AI power on documents that are too sensitive for the cloud.        |
| **Administrative Pro**  | Summarizing meeting notes and invoices.      | Turn a messy folder of documents into a searchable, structured report. |

## 4. Feature Translation Table

| Technical Feature            | Non-Technical Benefit                                     |
| :--------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sidecar Pattern**          | "Personal Brain" running locally.                         |
| **Visual Permissions**       | "The AI asks you before it touches anything."             |
| **Operation Journal**        | "Total Undo: Change your mind at any time."               |
| **BYOK (OpenRouter/Ollama)** | "Choose your AI provider; stay in control of your costs." |

## 5. Implementation Recommendations

1.  **Onboarding:** Ensure the "Select Folder" step is framed as "Giving Tandem its Library."
2.  **UI Tooltips:** Avoid "LLM" or "Context Window." Use "Intelligence Level" or "Memory Capacity."
3.  **About Page:** Emphasize the "Supervised Agent" pattern as "The AI is your contractor; you are the boss."
