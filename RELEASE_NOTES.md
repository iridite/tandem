# Release Notes

Canonical release notes live in `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md`.

## v0.2.10 (Unreleased)

- OpenCode: Prevent sessions from getting stuck indefinitely when a tool invocation never reaches a terminal state (ignore heartbeat/diff noise, treat more tool terminal statuses as `ToolEnd`, and add a fail-fast timeout that cancels the request and surfaces an error).
- Diagnostics: Add an on-demand Logs drawer that can tail Tandem app logs and show OpenCode sidecar stdout/stderr (captured into a bounded in-memory buffer). Streaming only runs while the viewer is open.
- Reliability: Ignore OpenCode `server.*` heartbeat SSE events (and downgrade other unknown SSE events) to prevent warning spam in logs.
- Providers: Add Poe as an OpenAI-compatible provider option (endpoint + `POE_API_KEY`). Thanks [@CamNoob](https://github.com/CamNoob).

## v0.2.9 (Unreleased)

- Memory: Incremental per-project workspace file indexing with percent progress, auto-index toggle, and a "Clear File Index" action to reclaim space.
- Memory: Vector Database Stats now supports All Projects vs Active Project scope.
- OpenCode: Properly handle question prompts (multi-question wizard with multiple-choice + custom answers).
- Sessions: On startup, automatically load session history for the last active folder (fixes empty sidebar until a manual refresh).
- Windows: Prevent orphaned OpenCode sidecar (and Bun) processes during `pnpm tauri dev` rebuilds by attaching the sidecar to a Job Object (kill-on-close).

## v0.2.8 (2026-02-09)

- Support multiple custom OpenCode providers by name: Tandem now lets you select arbitrary providers from the sidecar catalog (not just the built-in list) and persists the selection for routing.

## v0.2.7 (2026-02-08)

- Fix OpenCode config writes so existing `opencode.json` is not deleted if replacement fails (Windows-safe).
- Reduce sidecar idle memory usage with Bun/JSC environment hints.

## v0.2.6 (2026-02-08)

- Fix macOS release builds by disabling signing/notarization by default (can be enabled via `MACOS_SIGNING_ENABLED=true`).

## v0.2.5 (2026-02-08)

- Re-cut release to ensure CI/release builds run with the corrected GitHub Actions workflow.

## v0.2.4 (2026-02-08)

- Fixed Starter Pack installs failing in packaged builds (bundled resource path resolution).
- Fixed onboarding getting stuck for Custom providers (e.g. LM Studio) and bouncing users back to Settings.
- Added Vector DB stats + manual workspace indexing in Settings.
- Improved macOS release workflow with optional signing/notarization inputs and CI Gatekeeper verification.

## v0.2.3 (2026-02-08)

- Fixed Orchestration Mode creating endless new root chat sessions during execution.
