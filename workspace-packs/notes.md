# Tandem Micro-Drama Pack Builder + Script Generator Agent

## Overview

This document guides you through creating a professional Tandem Workspace Pack for micro-drama and short-form script writing. The pack demonstrates Tandem's multi-file context capabilities, supervised file writes, and HTML artifact generation.

### What is Micro-Drama?

Micro-drama is a short-form video script format (typically 60-180 seconds per episode) characterized by:

- Rapid plot development
- Strong emotional hooks in every scene
- Episode-based storytelling with cliffhangers
- Limited cast (2-5 main characters)
- Mobile-first, vertical video format

## Technical Notes

### File Reading Order

When Tandem processes this pack, files are read in this priority:

1. STYLE_GUIDE.md (defines all constraints)
2. SCRIPT_FORMAT.md (defines structure)
3. CHARACTER_SHEETS.md (reference for dialogue)
4. EXAMPLE_EPISODES/\*.md (format and tone examples)

### Output Naming Convention

Generated files follow this pattern:

- `outputs/episode_XXX.md` - Episode scripts
- `outputs/writers_room_dashboard_YYYYMMDD.html` - Dashboard artifacts
- `outputs/episode_beats_XXX.md` - Outline documents

### Character Name Convention

All character names should follow the pattern: `NAME_INITIAL` (e.g., `A:`, `B:`, `M:`, `W:`)
```

# Micro-Drama Style Guide

## Tone & Voice

### Primary Tonal Categories

| Tone          | Characteristics                   | Best For                  |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Emotional** | Melancholic, tender, heartwarming | Romance, family drama     |
| **Tense**     | Suspenseful, urgent, gripping     | Thriller, mystery         |
| **Uplifting** | Hopeful, warm, satisfying         | Comedy, success stories   |
| **Dramatic**  | Intense, pivotal moments          | Conflict-heavy narratives |

### Tone Rules

- Maintain ONE primary tone per episode
- Secondary tones can support (e.g., tense → hopeful resolution)
- Avoid tonal whiplash within single episode
- Match tone to platform and audience expectations

---

## Pacing Guidelines

### Episode Length Targets

| Format       | Duration | Scenes | Words (approx.) |
| ------------ | -------- | ------ | --------------- |
| **Short**    | 60-90s   | 3      | 150-250         |
| **Standard** | 90-120s  | 4      | 250-350         |
| **Extended** | 120-180s | 4-5    | 350-500         |

### Pacing Principles

1. **Hook by 5 seconds**: Visual or dialogue hook must grab attention
2. **Escalate every scene**: Each scene should increase tension/stakes
3. **Pause strategically**: One brief pause per episode for impact
4. **End on high**: Cliffhanger in final 15-20 seconds

### Rhythm Breakdown
```

0-10s: HOOK - Establish premise, grab attention
10-30s: SETUP - Introduce characters, establish conflict
30-60s: DEVELOPMENT - Complications, escalation
60-90s: COMPLICATION - Peak tension, key revelations
90-120s: CLIFFHANGER - End on unresolved tension

```

---

## Episode Structure

### Standard 4-Scene Structure

| Scene | Time | Purpose | Key Element |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | 0-30s | Hook & Setup | Inciting incident |
| 2 | 30-60s | Development | First complication |
| 3 | 60-90s | Escalation | Key revelation/twist |
| 4 | 90-120s | Resolution + Hook | Partial resolution, cliffhanger |

### Scene Requirements

Each scene must have:
- **Visual hook**: Something visually interesting happens
- **Clear purpose**: Advances plot OR develops character
- **Dialogue purpose**: Not just exposition—reveal character/conflict
- **Transition**: Clear to next scene (physical or emotional)

---

## Character Development

### Character Naming

Use initial-based naming for micro-drama:
- Single letter (A, B, C, D)
- Initial + descriptor (MA for "Mother", BO for "Boss")
- Avoid: Full names, gender-specific assumptions

### Character Consistency

- Maintain consistent speech patterns
- Character reactions should match established personality
- Growth should be earned, not sudden
- Keep cast small (2-5 characters per episode)

---

## Dialogue Guidelines

### Do's

- ✓ Use contractions for natural speech
- ✓ Keep lines under 20 words when possible
- ✓ Show emotion through subtext
- ✓ Vary sentence length (short for tension, longer for reflection)
- ✓ Use character-specific verbal quirks

### Don'ts

- ✗ On-the-nose exposition ("As you know, I'm your long-lost brother")
- ✗ Same-syllable repetition (he/she/they)
- ✗ Unnatural explanations for plot convenience
- ✗ More than 3 consecutive dialogue lines without action
- ✗ Breaking character for plot explanation

---

## Banned Content

### Absolute No-Go

- [ ] Graphic violence or gore
- [ ] Sexual content or nudity
- [ ] Hate speech or discrimination
- [ ] Illegal activities promoted
- [ ] Dangerous stunts or behaviors
- [ ] Real people or real brands
- [ ] Medical misinformation
- [ ] Self-harm or suicide encouragement

### Platform Restrictions

- [ ] Varies by platform (TikTok, Reels, Shorts)
- [ ] Check current community guidelines
- [ ] Avoid political content
- [ ] No copyrighted music/lyrics

---

## Formatting Conventions

### Scene Headings

```

INT. LOCATION - TIME

```
Examples:
```

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT
INT. OFFICE - MORNING

```

### Character Names

```

CHARACTER:
Dialogue here.

```

### Action Lines

- Present tense
- Visual and specific
- Under 2 lines when possible
- Describe what we SEE, not internal thoughts

### Parentheticals

Use sparingly for:
- Physical actions affecting delivery
- Which character they're speaking to
- Important emotional beats

Example:
```

A:
(holding out hand)
Take it.

```

### [beat] Notation

For significant pauses:
```

[beat] She realizes the truth.

```
