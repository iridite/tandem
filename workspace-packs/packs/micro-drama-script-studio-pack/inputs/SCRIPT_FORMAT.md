```

- Maximum 2-3 lines per action block
- One thought per sentence
- Avoid internal monologue (show through action)

```
A:
Dialogue goes here.
```

For multiple characters of same initial:

```
AA:
Dialogue here.
```

### Dialogue

```
CHARACTER:
Dialogue line.
```

Keep dialogue under 20 words when possible.

### Parentheticals

Use sparingly for:

- Physical action affecting delivery
- Who they're speaking to
- Important emotional beat

```
A:
(whispering)
I can't believe you came.
```

### Pauses

Use [beat] for significant pauses:

```
[beat]
A realizes the truth.
```

### Scene Transitions

```
FADE TO:

or

SMASH CUT TO BLACK.

or

TRANSITION:
```

### Cliffhanger Convention

End episodes with:

```
[beat]

CHARACTER:
Final line that creates intrigue.

[END EPISODE - CLIFFHANGER]
```

Or use:

```

[END EPISODE]
```

### Dialogue-Only Scenes

For minimal action, dialogue-heavy scenes:

```
INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A:
I never thought I'd see you here.

B:
Life's full of surprises.

A:
(softly)
Too many, sometimes.
```
