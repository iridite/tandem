# Micro-Drama Style Guide

## Tone & Voice

### Primary Tonal Categories

| Tone          | Characteristics                   | Best For                  |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Emotional** | Melancholic, tender, heartwarming | Romance, family drama     |
| **Tense**     | Suspenseful, urgent, gripping     | Thriller, mystery         |
| **Uplifting** | Hopeful, warm, satisfying         | Comedy, success stories   |
| **Dramatic**  | Intense, pivotal moments          | Conflict-heavy narratives |

### Tone Rules

- Maintain ONE primary tone per episode
- Secondary tones can support (e.g., tense → hopeful resolution)
- Avoid tonal whiplash within single episode
- Match tone to platform and audience expectations

## Pacing Guidelines

### Episode Length Targets

| Format       | Duration | Scenes | Words (approx.) |
| ------------ | -------- | ------ | --------------- |
| **Short**    | 60-90s   | 3      | 150-250         |
| **Standard** | 90-120s  | 4      | 250-350         |
| **Extended** | 120-180s | 4-5    | 350-500         |

### Pacing Principles

1. **Hook by 5 seconds**: Visual or dialogue hook must grab attention
2. **Escalate every scene**: Each scene should increase tension/stakes
3. **Pause strategically**: One brief pause per episode for impact
4. **End on high**: Cliffhanger in final 15-20 seconds

### Rhythm Breakdown

```
0-10s:  HOOK - Establish premise, grab attention
10-30s: SETUP - Introduce characters, establish conflict
30-60s: DEVELOPMENT - Complications, escalation
60-90s: COMPLICATION - Peak tension, key revelations
90-120s: CLIFFHANGER - End on unresolved tension
```

## Episode Structure

### Standard 4-Scene Structure

| Scene | Time    | Purpose           | Key Element                     |
| ----- | ------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1     | 0-30s   | Hook & Setup      | Inciting incident               |
| 2     | 30-60s  | Development       | First complication              |
| 3     | 60-90s  | Escalation        | Key revelation/twist            |
| 4     | 90-120s | Resolution + Hook | Partial resolution, cliffhanger |

### Scene Requirements

Each scene must have:

- **Visual hook**: Something visually interesting happens
- **Clear purpose**: Advances plot OR develops character
- **Dialogue purpose**: Not just exposition—reveal character/conflict
- **Transition**: Clear to next scene (physical or emotional)

---

## Character Development

### Character Naming

Use initial-based naming for micro-drama:

- Single letter (A, B, C, D)
- Initial + descriptor (MA for "Mother", BO for "Boss")
- Avoid: Full names, gender-specific assumptions

### Character Consistency

- Maintain consistent speech patterns
- Character reactions should match established personality
- Growth should be earned, not sudden
- Keep cast small (2-5 characters per episode)

---

## Dialogue Guidelines

### Do's

- ✓ Use contractions for natural speech
- ✓ Keep lines under 20 words when possible
- ✓ Show emotion through subtext
- ✓ Vary sentence length (short for tension, longer for reflection)
- ✓ Use character-specific verbal quirks

### Don'ts

- ✗ On-the-nose exposition ("As you know, I'm your long-lost brother")
- ✗ Same-syllable repetition (he/she/they)
- ✗ Unnatural explanations for plot convenience
- ✗ More than 3 consecutive dialogue lines without action
- ✗ Breaking character for plot explanation

## Banned Content

- [ ] Graphic violence or gore
- [ ] Sexual content or nudity
- [ ] Hate speech or discrimination
- [ ] Illegal activities promoted

## Formatting Conventions

### Scene Headings

```
INT. LOCATION - TIME
```

Examples:

```
INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT
INT. OFFICE - MORNING
```

### Character Names

```
CHARACTER:
Dialogue here.
```

### Action Lines

- Present tense
- Visual and specific
- Under 2 lines when possible
- Describe what we SEE, not internal thoughts

### Parentheticals

Use sparingly for:

- Physical actions affecting delivery
- Which character they're speaking to
- Important emotional beats

Example:

```
A:
(holding out hand)
Take it.
```

### [beat] Notation

For significant pauses:

```
[beat] She realizes the truth.
```
