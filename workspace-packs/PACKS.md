## Pack Structure Standard

Each pack directory contains **only realistic inputs** - no meta files or documentation. This ensures LLMs evaluate the packs as they would appear in real use:

```
packs/<PACK_SLUG>/
├── inputs/                # Curated source materials (visible to LLM)
│   ├── *.md               # Input documents
│   └── papers/            # (optional) Paper collection
├── outputs/               # Generated content (runtime only)
│   └── .gitkeep           # Keep empty outputs directory
└── src/                   # (optional) Source files for audit packs
```

### Pack Documentation (in pack-docs/)

Metadata and instructions are stored separately to maintain realism:

```
pack-docs/<PACK_SLUG>/
├── PACK_INFO.md           # Pack metadata and description
├── START_HERE.md          # Step-by-step user instructions
├── PROMPTS.md             # Five copy/paste prompts for Tandem
└── EXPECTED_OUTPUTS.md    # Quality criteria and validation
```

### Why Separate Documentation?

Keeping meta files outside the pack directories ensures:

- **Realistic evaluation**: LLMs see only the inputs, not the "answers"
- **Clean user experience**: Users follow prompts from pack-docs/
- **Separation of concerns**: Pack content vs. pack instructions are distinct

---

## Global Constraints

All packs adhere to these standards:

- **Safe to publish**: Synthetic/original content only, no secrets, no personal data, no copyrighted third-party assets
- **Size limit**: Each pack < 15 MB (prefer < 10 MB)
- **HTML artifact**: Prompt 5 must generate an HTML file to `outputs/<name>.html`
- **Consistent prompts**: Exactly 5 prompts per pack

---

## Creating New Packs

To create a new pack:

1. **Create pack directory**: `workspace-packs/packs/<PACK_SLUG>/`
2. **Add realistic inputs**: Create inputs/ with appropriate source materials
3. **Add outputs/.gitkeep**: Create empty outputs directory
4. **Add src/ if needed**: For audit/code packs, add source files
5. **Create pack docs**: Add files to `workspace-packs/pack-docs/<PACK_SLUG>/`
   - PACK_INFO.md
   - START_HERE.md
   - PROMPTS.md
   - EXPECTED_OUTPUTS.md
6. **Update catalog**: Add pack to PACKS.md

### Pack Naming Convention

- Use kebab-case: `<purpose>-pack`
- Example: `research-synthesis-pack`, `web-starter-audit-pack`
- Keep under 40 characters

### Content Guidelines

- All synthetic content (no real company data, no personal information)
- Original text written for the pack
- Realistic but fictional examples
- Safe for public distribution
