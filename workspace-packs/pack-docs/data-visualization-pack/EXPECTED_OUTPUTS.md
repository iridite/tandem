# Expected Outputs

## Files

- `output_chart.png`: A high-resolution PNG file (from Matplotlib/Seaborn).
- `interactive_chart.html`: A standalone HTML file containing the interactive chart (from Plotly).

## Visuals

- **Matplotlib**: Clean, minimal charts with high readability, suitable for embedding in PDFs or slides.
- **Seaborn**: aesthetically pleasing statistical plots (box plots, violins, joint plots) with informative default styles.
- **Plotly**: Charts that open in a web browser, allowing you to hover over data points, zoom in/out, and toggle series on/off.
