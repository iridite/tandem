## Technical Notes

### File Reading Order

When Tandem processes this pack, files are read in this priority:

1. STYLE_GUIDE.md (defines all constraints)
2. SCRIPT_FORMAT.md (defines structure)
3. CHARACTER_SHEETS.md (reference for dialogue)
4. EXAMPLE_EPISODES/\*.md (format and tone examples)

### Output Naming Convention

Generated files follow this pattern:

- `outputs/episode_XXX.md` - Episode scripts
- `outputs/writers_room_dashboard_YYYYMMDD.html` - Dashboard artifacts
- `outputs/episode_beats_XXX.md` - Outline documents

### Character Name Convention

All character names should follow the pattern: `NAME_INITIAL` (e.g., `A:`, `B:`, `M:`, `W:`)
