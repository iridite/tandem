# Security Policy

## Tandem Security Model

Tandem is built with a **zero-trust, security-first** architecture. This document outlines our security model and how to report vulnerabilities.

## Security Features

### 1. Encrypted Credential Storage

- API keys are encrypted using AES-256-GCM via SecureKeyStore
- Keys are never stored in plaintext or exposed to the frontend
- Master password derived from user input + machine ID

### 2. Sandboxed File Access

- AI can only access explicitly granted workspace folders
- Sensitive paths are permanently denied (`.env`, `.ssh`, `.gnupg`, `*.pem`, `*.key`)
- All file operations are validated before execution

### 3. Network Isolation

- Strict Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Only allowlisted endpoints can be contacted:
  - `127.0.0.1` (local sidecar)
  - `openrouter.ai`
  - `api.anthropic.com`
  - `api.openai.com`
  - User-configured custom endpoints

### 4. Supervised Agent Pattern

- AI sidecar is treated as untrusted
- All operations go through the Tool Proxy
- User approval required for write/delete operations
- Full operation journal with undo capability

### 5. Zero Telemetry

- No analytics or tracking
- No "call home" functionality
- All data stays on your device

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security concerns to: [info@frumu.ai] (replace with actual email)
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- Acknowledgment within 48 hours
- Regular updates on our progress
- Credit in security advisories (if desired)
- We aim to fix critical vulnerabilities within 7 days

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Best Practices for Users

1. **Keep Tandem updated** - We regularly release security patches
2. **Use strong API keys** - Rotate keys periodically
3. **Limit workspace scope** - Only grant access to folders you need
4. **Review permissions** - Check what operations you're approving
5. **Use local models** - For sensitive work, consider Ollama
