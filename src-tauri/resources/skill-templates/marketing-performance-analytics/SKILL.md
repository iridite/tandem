# Performance Analytics Skill

Frameworks for measuring, reporting, and optimizing marketing performance across channels and campaigns.

## Key Marketing Metrics by Channel

### Email Marketing

- **Delivery rate**: Emails delivered / emails sent (Target: 95-99%)
- **Open rate**: Unique opens / emails delivered (Target: 15-30%)
- **Click-through rate (CTR)**: Unique clicks / emails delivered (Target: 2-5%)
- **Unsubscribe rate**: Unsubscribes / emails delivered (Target: <0.5%)
- **Conversion rate**: Conversions / emails delivered (Target: 1-5%)

### Social Media

- **Impressions**: Total times content was displayed
- **Reach**: Unique users who saw content
- **Engagement rate**: (Likes + comments + shares) / reach
- **Click-through rate**: Link clicks / impressions
- **Follower growth rate**: Net new followers / total followers

### Paid Advertising (Search and Social)

- **Click-through rate (CTR)**: Clicks / impressions
- **Cost per click (CPC)**: Total spend / clicks
- **Cost per acquisition (CPA)**: Total spend / conversions
- **Return on ad spend (ROAS)**: Revenue / ad spend
- **Quality Score (search)**: Relevance rating (1-10)

### SEO / Organic Search

- **Organic sessions**: Visits from organic search
- **Keyword rankings**: Position for target keywords
- **Organic CTR**: Clicks / impressions in search results
- **Domain authority**: Third-party authority score
- **Backlinks**: External sites linking to you

### Content Marketing

- **Pageviews**: Total views of content pages
- **Average time on page**: Time spent on content pages
- **Bounce rate**: Single-page sessions / total sessions
- **Scroll depth**: How far users scroll on a page
- **Lead generation**: Leads attributed to content

### Overall Marketing / Pipeline

- **Marketing qualified leads (MQLs)**: Leads meeting qualification criteria
- **Sales qualified leads (SQLs)**: MQLs accepted by sales
- **MQL to SQL conversion rate**: SQLs / MQLs
- **Customer acquisition cost (CAC)**: Total marketing + sales cost / new customers
- **Marketing-sourced revenue**: Revenue from marketing-originated deals

## Reporting Templates and Dashboards

### Weekly Marketing Report

- **Top 3 metrics** with week-over-week change
- **What worked** this week (1-2 bullet points with data)
- **What needs attention** (1-2 bullet points with data)
- **This week's priorities** (3-5 action items)

### Monthly Marketing Report

1.  Executive summary (3-5 sentences)
2.  Key metrics dashboard (MoM and target comparison)
3.  Channel-by-channel performance summary
4.  Campaign highlights and results
5.  What worked and what did not (with hypotheses)
6.  Recommendations and next month priorities

### Dashboard Design Principles

- Lead with metrics that map to business objectives
- Show trends over time, not just point-in-time snapshots
- Include comparison context: prior period, target, benchmark
- Group metrics by funnel stage or business question
- Keep dashboards to one page/screen

## Trend Analysis and Forecasting

### Trend Identification

Look for:

1.  **Directional trends**: consistent movement over 4+ periods
2.  **Inflection points**: where performance changed direction
3.  **Seasonality**: predictable patterns by day, month, or quarter
4.  **Anomalies**: one-time spikes or drops
5.  **Leading indicators**: metrics that predict future outcomes

### Simple Forecasting Approaches

- **Linear projection**: extend current trend line forward
- **Moving average**: smooth out noise by averaging last 3-6 periods
- **Year-over-year comparison**: use last year's pattern adjusted for growth
- **Funnel math**: forecast outputs from inputs (Leads \* Conversion Rate = Customers)

## Attribution Modeling Basics

### Common Attribution Models

- **Last touch**: 100% credit to last interaction
- **First touch**: 100% credit to first interaction
- **Linear**: Equal credit to all touchpoints
- **Time decay**: More credit to touchpoints closer to conversion
- **Position-based (U-shaped)**: 40% first, 40% last, 20% split middle

### Attribution Practical Guidance

- Start with last-touch if you have no model in place
- Compare first-touch and last-touch to understand awareness vs. conversion drivers
- Use position-based as a reasonable middle ground for B2B
- No model is perfect — use attribution directionally

## Optimization Recommendations Framework

### Optimization Process

1.  **Identify**: which metrics are underperforming?
2.  **Diagnose**: where in the funnel is the problem?
3.  **Hypothesize**: what is causing the underperformance?
4.  **Prioritize**: which fixes have the biggest impact with least effort?
5.  **Test**: design an experiment to validate the hypothesis
6.  **Measure**: did the change improve the metric?
7.  **Scale or iterate**: roll out wins; iterate on failed tests

### Prioritization Framework (Impact vs. Effort)

1.  **High impact, low effort**: do immediately
2.  **High impact, high effort**: plan and resource
3.  **Low impact, low effort**: do if capacity allows
4.  **Low impact, high effort**: deprioritize
