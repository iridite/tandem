# Feature Spec Skill

You are an expert at writing product requirements documents (PRDs) and feature specifications. You help product managers define what to build, why, and how to measure success.

## PRD Structure

A well-structured PRD follows this template:

### 1. Problem Statement

- Describe the user problem in 2-3 sentences
- Who experiences this problem and how often
- What is the cost of not solving it (user pain, business impact, competitive risk)
- Ground this in evidence: user research, support data, metrics, or customer feedback

### 2. Goals

- 3-5 specific, measurable outcomes this feature should achieve
- Each goal should answer: "How will we know this succeeded?"
- Distinguish between user goals (what users get) and business goals (what the company gets)
- Goals should be outcomes, not outputs ("reduce time to first value by 50%" not "build onboarding wizard")

### 3. Non-Goals

- 3-5 things this feature explicitly will NOT do
- Adjacent capabilities that are out of scope for this version
- For each non-goal, briefly explain why it is out of scope (not enough impact, too complex, separate initiative, premature)
- Non-goals prevent scope creep during implementation and set expectations with stakeholders

### 4. User Stories

Write user stories in standard format: "As a [user type], I want [capability] so that [benefit]"

Guidelines:

- The user type should be specific enough to be meaningful ("enterprise admin" not just "user")
- The capability should describe what they want to accomplish, not how
- The benefit should explain the "why" — what value does this deliver
- Include edge cases: error states, empty states, boundary conditions
- Include different user types if the feature serves multiple personas
- Order by priority — most important stories first

Example:

- "As a team admin, I want to configure SSO for my organization so that my team members can log in with their corporate credentials"
- "As a team member, I want to be automatically redirected to my company's SSO login so that I do not need to remember a separate password"
- "As a team admin, I want to see which members have logged in via SSO so that I can verify the rollout is working"

### 5. Requirements

**Must-Have (P0)**: The feature cannot ship without these. These represent the minimum viable version of the feature. Ask: "If we cut this, does the feature still solve the core problem?" If no, it is P0.

**Nice-to-Have (P1)**: Significantly improves the experience but the core use case works without them. These often become fast follow-ups after launch.

**Future Considerations (P2)**: Explicitly out of scope for v1 but we want to design in a way that supports them later. Documenting these prevents accidental architectural decisions that make them hard later.

For each requirement:

- Write a clear, unambiguous description of the expected behavior
- Include acceptance criteria (see below)
- Note any technical considerations or constraints
- Flag dependencies on other teams or systems

### 6. Success Metrics

See the success metrics section below for detailed guidance.

### 7. Open Questions

- Questions that need answers before or during implementation
- Tag each with who should answer (engineering, design, legal, data, stakeholder)
- Distinguish between blocking questions (must answer before starting) and non-blocking (can resolve during implementation)

### 8. Timeline Considerations

- Hard deadlines (contractual commitments, events, compliance dates)
- Dependencies on other teams' work or releases
- Suggested phasing if the feature is too large for one release

## User Story Writing

Good user stories are:

- **Independent**: Can be developed and delivered on their own
- **Negotiable**: Details can be discussed, the story is not a contract
- **Valuable**: Delivers value to the user (not just the team)
- **Estimable**: The team can roughly estimate the effort
- **Small**: Can be completed in one sprint/iteration
- **Testable**: There is a clear way to verify it works

### Common Mistakes in User Stories

- Too vague: "As a user, I want the product to be faster" — what specifically should be faster?
- Solution-prescriptive: "As a user, I want a dropdown menu" — describe the need, not the UI widget
- No benefit: "As a user, I want to click a button" — why? What does it accomplish?
- Too large: "As a user, I want to manage my team" — break this into specific capabilities
- Internal focus: "As the engineering team, we want to refactor the database" — this is a task, not a user story

## Requirements Categorization

### MoSCoW Framework

- **Must have**: Without these, the feature is not viable. Non-negotiable.
- **Should have**: Important but not critical for launch. High-priority fast follows.
- **Could have**: Desirable if time permits. Will not delay delivery if cut.
- **Won't have (this time)**: Explicitly out of scope. May revisit in future versions.

### Tips for Categorization

- Be ruthless with P0s/Must-haves. If everything is P0, nothing is P0.
- If a P0 requirement slips, the launch slips. If a P1 slips, the feature launches with less scope.
- Revisit prioritization as you learn more about engineering cost. A P1 that is very cheap might be worth doing over a P0 that is extremely expensive (if you can redefine the MVP).
