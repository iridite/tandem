# Competitive Intelligence

Research your competitors extensively and generate an **interactive HTML battlecard** you can use in deals. The output is a self-contained artifact with clickable competitor tabs and an overall comparison matrix.

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ALWAYS (works standalone via web search)                        │
│  ✓ Competitor product deep-dive: features, pricing, positioning │
│  ✓ Recent releases: what they've shipped in last 90 days        │
│  ✓ Your company releases: what you've shipped to counter        │
│  ✓ Differentiation matrix: where you win vs. where they win     │
│  ✓ Sales talk tracks: how to position against each competitor   │
│  ✓ Landmine questions: expose their weaknesses naturally        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  OUTPUT: Interactive HTML Battlecard                             │
│  ✓ Comparison matrix overview                                    │
│  ✓ Clickable tabs for each competitor                           │
│  ✓ Dark theme, professional styling                             │
│  ✓ Self-contained HTML file — share or host anywhere            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  SUPERCHARGED (when you connect your tools)                      │
│  + CRM: Win/loss data, competitor mentions in closed deals      │
│  + Docs: Existing battlecards, competitive playbooks            │
│  + Chat: Internal intel, field reports from colleagues          │
│  + Transcripts: Competitor mentions in customer calls           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Getting Started

When you run this skill, I'll ask for context:

**Required:**

- What company do you work for? (or I'll detect from your email)
- Who are your main competitors? (1-5 names)

**Optional:**

- Which competitor do you want to focus on first?
- Any specific deals where you're competing against them?
- Pain points you've heard from customers about competitors?

If I already have your seller context from a previous session, I'll confirm and skip the questions.

## Connectors (Optional)

| Connector       | What It Adds                                                                |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CRM**         | Win/loss history against each competitor, deal-level competitor tracking    |
| **Docs**        | Existing battlecards, product comparison docs, competitive playbooks        |
| **Chat**        | Internal chat intel (e.g. Slack) — what your team is hearing from the field |
| **Transcripts** | Competitor mentions in customer calls, objections raised                    |

> **No connectors?** Web research works great. I'll pull everything from public sources — product pages, pricing, blogs, release notes, reviews, job postings.

## Output: Interactive HTML Battlecard

The skill generates a **self-contained HTML file** with:

### 1. Comparison Matrix (Landing View)

Overview comparing you vs. all competitors at a glance:

- Feature comparison grid
- Pricing comparison
- Market positioning
- Win rate indicators (if CRM connected)

### 2. Competitor Tabs (Click to Expand)

Each competitor gets a clickable card that expands to show:

- Company profile (size, funding, target market)
- What they sell and how they position
- Recent releases (last 90 days)
- Where they win vs. where you win
- Pricing intelligence
- Talk tracks for different scenarios
- Objection handling
- Landmine questions

### 3. Your Company Card

- Your releases (last 90 days)
- Your key differentiators
- Proof points and customer quotes
