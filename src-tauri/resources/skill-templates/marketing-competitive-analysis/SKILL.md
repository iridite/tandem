# Competitive Analysis Skill

Frameworks and methodologies for researching competitors, comparing positioning, and identifying market opportunities.

## Competitive Research Methodology

### Research Sources

Gather intelligence from these categories of sources:

#### Primary Sources (Direct from Competitor)

- **Website**: homepage, product pages, pricing, about page, careers
- **Blog and resource center**: content themes, publishing frequency, depth
- **Social media profiles**: messaging, engagement, content strategy
- **Product demos and free trials**: UX, features, onboarding experience
- **Webinars and events**: topics, speakers, audience engagement
- **Press releases and newsroom**: announcements, partnerships, milestones
- **Job postings**: hiring signals that reveal strategic priorities

#### Secondary Sources (Third-Party)

- **Review sites**: G2, Capterra, TrustRadius, Product Hunt — customer sentiment themes
- **Analyst reports**: Gartner, Forrester, IDC — market positioning and category placement
- **News coverage**: TechCrunch, industry publications — funding, partnerships, narrative
- **Social listening**: mentions, sentiment, share of voice across social platforms
- **SEO tools**: keyword rankings, organic traffic estimates, content gaps
- **Financial filings**: revenue, growth rate, investment areas (for public companies)
- **Community forums**: Reddit, Discourse, industry Slack communities — user sentiment

### Research Process

1.  **Set scope**: define which competitors and what aspects to analyze
2.  **Gather data**: systematically collect information from sources above
3.  **Organize findings**: structure by competitor, then by dimension
4.  **Analyze patterns**: identify themes, strengths, weaknesses, and trends
5.  **Compare to your position**: map findings against your own positioning and capabilities
6.  **Synthesize insights**: extract actionable takeaways and opportunities
7.  **Date-stamp everything**: competitive intelligence has a short shelf life

### Research Cadence

- **Deep competitive analysis**: quarterly (full research across all sources)
- **Competitive monitoring**: monthly (scan for new announcements, content, messaging changes)
- **Real-time alerts**: ongoing (set up alerts for competitor brand mentions, press, job postings)

## Messaging Comparison Frameworks

### Messaging Matrix

Compare messaging across competitors on key dimensions:

| Dimension                | Your Company | Competitor A | Competitor B | Competitor C |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Tagline/Headline         |              |              |              |              |
| Core value proposition   |              |              |              |              |
| Primary audience         |              |              |              |              |
| Key differentiator claim |              |              |              |              |
| Tone/Voice               |              |              |              |              |
| Proof points used        |              |              |              |              |
| Category framing         |              |              |              |              |
| Primary CTA              |              |              |              |              |

### Value Proposition Comparison

For each competitor, document:

- **Promise**: what they promise the customer will achieve
- **Evidence**: how they prove the promise (data, testimonials, demos)
- **Mechanism**: how their product delivers on the promise (the "how it works")
- **Uniqueness**: what they claim only they can do

### Narrative Analysis

Identify each competitor's story arc:

- **Villain**: what problem or enemy they position against (status quo, legacy tools, complexity)
- **Hero**: who is the hero in their story (the customer? the product? the team?)
- **Transformation**: what before/after do they promise?
- **Stakes**: what happens if you do not act?

## Content Gap Analysis

### Content Audit Comparison

Map content across competitors by topic and format to identify gaps and opportunities.

| Topic/Theme | Your Content     | Competitor A         | Competitor B     | Gap?              |
| ----------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| [Topic 1]   | Blog post, ebook | Blog series, webinar | Nothing          | Opportunity for B |
| [Topic 2]   | Nothing          | Whitepaper           | Blog post, video | Gap for you       |
| [Topic 3]   | Case study       | Nothing              | Case study       | Parity            |

### Identifying Content Opportunities

1.  **Topics they cover that you do not**: potential gaps in your content strategy
2.  **Topics you cover that they do not**: potential differentiators to amplify
3.  **Formats they use that you do not**: format gaps that could reach new audiences
4.  **Audience segments they address that you do not**: underserved audiences
5.  **Search terms they rank for that you do not**: SEO content gaps

## Positioning Strategy

### Positioning Statement Framework

For your company and each competitor, define their positioning statement:

> For [target audience], [product/company] is the [category] that [key benefit/differentiator] because [reason to believe].

### Positioning Map

Plot competitors on a 2x2 matrix using the two most important dimensions for your market (e.g., Price vs. Capability, Ease of Use vs. Power).

### Category Strategy

- **Create a new category**: define and own a new category (high risk, high reward)
- **Reframe the existing category**: change how buyers evaluate the category
- **Win the existing category**: compete directly on recognized criteria
- **Niche within the category**: own a specific segment or use case

## Battlecard Creation

### Battlecard Structure

A competitive battlecard is a one-page reference for sales and marketing teams.

#### Quick Overview

- What they do (one sentence)
- Their target customer
- Pricing model summary
- Key recent developments

#### Strengths and Weaknesses

- **Strengths**: where they genuinely compete well
- **Weaknesses**: customer complaints, technical limitations, gaps in offering

#### Our Differentiators

- 3-5 specific ways your product or approach is different
- For each: the differentiator, why it matters, and proof

#### Objection Handling

| If the prospect says...   | Respond with...                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| "[Competitor] does X too" | "Here is how our approach differs..."            |
| "[Competitor] is cheaper" | "Here is what that price difference gets you..." |

#### Landmines to Set

Questions to ask prospects that highlight your advantages:

- "How do you currently handle [area where competitor is weak]?"
- "How important is [capability you have that they lack]?"
