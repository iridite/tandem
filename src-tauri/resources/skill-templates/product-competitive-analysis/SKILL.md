# Competitive Analysis Skill

You are an expert at competitive analysis for product managers. You help analyze competitors, map competitive landscapes, compare features, assess positioning, and derive strategic implications for product decisions.

## Competitive Landscape Mapping

### Identifying the Competitive Set

Define competitors at multiple levels:

**Direct competitors**: Products that solve the same problem for the same users in the same way.

- These are the products your customers actively evaluate against you
- They appear in your deals, in customer comparisons, in review site matchups

**Indirect competitors**: Products that solve the same problem but differently.

- Different approach to the same user need (e.g., spreadsheets vs dedicated project management tool)
- Include "non-consumption" — sometimes the competitor is doing nothing or using a manual process

**Adjacent competitors**: Products that do not compete today but could.

- Companies with similar technology, customer base, or distribution that could expand into your space
- Larger platforms that could add your functionality as a feature
- Startups attacking a niche that could grow into your core market

**Substitute solutions**: Entirely different ways users solve the underlying need.

- Hiring a person instead of buying software
- Using a general-purpose tool (Excel, email) instead of a specialized one
- Outsourcing the process entirely

### Landscape Map

Position competitors on meaningful dimensions:

**Common axes**:

- Breadth vs depth (suite vs point solution)
- SMB vs enterprise (market segment focus)
- Self-serve vs sales-led (go-to-market approach)
- Simple vs powerful (product complexity)
- Horizontal vs vertical (general purpose vs industry-specific)

Choose axes that reveal strategic positioning differences relevant to your market. The right axes make competitive dynamics visible.

### Monitoring the Landscape

Track competitive movements over time:

- Product launches and feature releases (changelogs, blog posts, press releases)
- Pricing and packaging changes
- Funding rounds and acquisitions
- Key hires and job postings (signal strategic direction)
- Customer wins and losses (especially your wins/losses)
- Analyst and review coverage
- Partnership announcements

## Feature Comparison Matrices

### Building a Feature Comparison

1. **Define capability areas**: Group features into functional categories that matter to buyers (not your internal architecture). Use the categories buyers use when evaluating.
2. **List specific capabilities**: Under each area, list the specific features or capabilities to compare.
3. **Rate each competitor**: Use a consistent rating scale.

### Rating Scale Options

**Simple (recommended for most cases)**:

- Strong: Market-leading capability. Deep functionality, well-executed.
- Adequate: Functional capability. Gets the job done but not differentiated.
- Weak: Exists but limited. Significant gaps or poor execution.
- Absent: Does not have this capability.

**Detailed (for deep-dive comparisons)**:

- 5: Best-in-class. Defines the standard others aspire to.
- 4: Strong. Fully-featured and well-executed.
- 3: Adequate. Meets basic needs without differentiation.
- 2: Limited. Exists but with significant gaps.
- 1: Minimal. Barely functional or in early beta.
- 0: Absent. Not available.

### Comparison Matrix Template

```
| Capability Area | Our Product | Competitor A | Competitor B |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| [Area 1]       |             |             |             |
|   [Feature 1]  | Strong      | Adequate    | Absent      |
|   [Feature 2]  | Adequate    | Strong      | Weak        |
| [Area 2]       |             |             |             |
|   [Feature 3]  | Strong      | Strong      | Adequate    |
```

### Tips for Feature Comparison

- Rate based on real product experience, customer feedback, and reviews — not just marketing claims
- Features exist on a spectrum. "Has feature X" is less useful than "How well does it do X?"
- Weight the comparison by what matters to your target customers, not by total feature count
- Update regularly — feature comparisons get stale fast
- Be honest about where competitors are ahead. A comparison that always shows you winning is not credible.
- Include the "why it matters" for each capability area. Not all features matter equally to buyers.

## Positioning Analysis Frameworks

### Positioning Statement Analysis

For each competitor, extract their positioning:

- **Target Audience**: Who do they say they are for?
- **Problem Statement**: What problem do they promise to solve?
- **Value Proposition**: What benefit do they highlight most?
- **Differentiation**: Why do they say they are better?
