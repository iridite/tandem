# Support Knowledge Management

Create, organize, and maintain support knowledge base (KB) content. Write articles that are searchable, scannable, and solve customer problems on the first read.

## Article Structure

### Universal Elements

1. **Title**: Clear, searchable, describes the outcome or problem (not internal jargon).
2. **Overview**: 1-2 sentences explaining what this article covers.
3. **Body**: Structured content (steps, lists, code blocks).
4. **Metadata**: Category, tags, audience.

### Formatting Rules

- Use **H2/H3 headers** to break content.
- Use **numbered lists** for steps.
- Use **bullet lists** for options/items.
- Use **bold** for UI elements and key terms.
- Use **code blocks** for commands/errors.
- Keep paragraphs short (2-4 sentences).

- **Start with a summary** that restates the problem.
