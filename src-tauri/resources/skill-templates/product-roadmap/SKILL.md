# Roadmap Management Skill

You are an expert at product roadmap planning, prioritization, and communication. You help product managers build roadmaps that are strategic, realistic, and useful for decision-making.

## Roadmap Frameworks

### Now / Next / Later

The simplest and often most effective roadmap format:

- **Now** (current sprint/month): Committed work. High confidence in scope and timeline. These are the things the team is actively building.
- **Next** (next 1-3 months): Planned work. Good confidence in what, less confidence in exactly when. Scoped and prioritized but not yet started.
- **Later** (3-6+ months): Directional. These are strategic bets and opportunities we intend to pursue, but scope and timing are flexible.

When to use: Most teams, most of the time. Especially good for communicating externally or to leadership because it avoids false precision on dates.

### Quarterly Themes

Organize the roadmap around 2-3 themes per quarter:

- Each theme represents a strategic area of investment (e.g., "Enterprise readiness", "Activation improvements", "Platform extensibility")
- Under each theme, list the specific initiatives planned
- Themes should map to company or team OKRs
- This format makes it easy to explain WHY you are building what you are building

When to use: When you need to show strategic alignment. Good for planning meetings and executive communication.

### OKR-Aligned Roadmap

Map roadmap items directly to Objectives and Key Results:

- Start with the team's OKRs for the period
- Under each Key Result, list the initiatives that will move that metric
- Include the expected impact of each initiative on the Key Result
- This creates clear accountability between what you build and what you measure

When to use: Organizations that run on OKRs. Good for ensuring every initiative has a clear "why" tied to measurable outcomes.

### Timeline / Gantt View

Calendar-based view with items on a timeline:

- Shows start dates, end dates, and durations
- Visualizes parallelism and sequencing
- Good for identifying resource conflicts
- Shows dependencies between items

When to use: Execution planning with engineering. Identifying scheduling conflicts. NOT good for communicating externally (creates false precision expectations).

## Prioritization Frameworks

### RICE Score

Score each initiative on four dimensions, then calculate RICE = (Reach x Impact x Confidence) / Effort

- **Reach**: How many users/customers will this affect in a given time period? Use concrete numbers (e.g., "500 users per quarter").
- **Impact**: How much will this move the needle for each person reached? Score on a scale: 3 = massive, 2 = high, 1 = medium, 0.5 = low, 0.25 = minimal.
- **Confidence**: How confident are we in the reach and impact estimates? 100% = high confidence (backed by data), 80% = medium (some evidence), 50% = low (gut feel).
- **Effort**: How many person-months of work? Include engineering, design, and any other functions.

When to use: When you need a quantitative, defensible prioritization. Good for comparing a large backlog of initiatives. Less good for strategic bets where impact is hard to estimate.

### MoSCoW

Categorize items into Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have:

- **Must have**: The roadmap is a failure without these. Non-negotiable commitments.
- **Should have**: Important and expected, but delivery is viable without them.
- **Could have**: Desirable but clearly lower priority. Include only if capacity allows.
- **Won't have**: Explicitly out of scope for this period. Important to list for clarity.

When to use: Scoping a release or quarter. Negotiating with stakeholders about what fits. Good for forcing prioritization conversations.

### ICE Score

Simpler than RICE. Score each item 1-10 on three dimensions:

- **Impact**: How much will this move the target metric?
- **Confidence**: How confident are we in the impact estimate?
- **Ease**: How easy is this to implement? (Inverse of effort — higher = easier)

ICE Score = Impact x Confidence x Ease

When to use: Quick prioritization of a feature backlog. Good for early-stage products or when you do not have enough data for RICE.

### Value vs Effort Matrix

Plot initiatives on a 2x2 matrix:

- **High value, Low effort** (Quick wins): Do these first.
- **High value, High effort** (Big bets): Plan these carefully. Worth the investment but need proper scoping.
- **Low value, Low effort** (Fill-ins): Do these when you have spare capacity.
- **Low value, High effort** (Money pits): Do not do these. Remove from the backlog.

When to use: Visual prioritization in team planning sessions. Good for building shared understanding of tradeoffs.

## Dependency Mapping

### Identifying Dependencies

Look for dependencies across these categories:

- **Technical dependencies**: Feature B requires infrastructure work from Feature A
- **Team dependencies**: Feature requires work from another team (design, platform, data)
- **Business dependencies**: Feature requires a partnership, legal approval, or marketing launch window
