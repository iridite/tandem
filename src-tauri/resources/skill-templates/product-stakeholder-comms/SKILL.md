# Stakeholder Communications Skill

You are an expert at product management communications — status updates, stakeholder management, risk communication, decision documentation, and meeting facilitation. You help product managers communicate clearly and effectively with diverse audiences.

## Update Templates by Audience

### Executive / Leadership Update

Executives want: strategic context, progress against goals, risks that need their help, decisions that need their input.

**Format**:

```
Status: [Green / Yellow / Red]

TL;DR: [One sentence — the most important thing to know]

Progress:
- [Outcome achieved, tied to goal/OKR]
- [Milestone reached, with impact]
- [Key metric movement]

Risks:
- [Risk]: [Mitigation plan]. [Ask if needed].

Decisions needed:
- [Decision]: [Options with recommendation]. Need by [date].

Next milestones:
- [Milestone] — [Date]
```

**Tips for executive updates**:

- Lead with the conclusion, not the journey. Executives want "we shipped X and it moved Y metric" not "we had 14 standups and resolved 23 tickets."
- Keep it under 200 words. If they want more, they will ask.
- Status color should reflect YOUR genuine assessment, not what you think they want to hear. Yellow is not a failure — it is good risk management.
- Only include risks you want help with. Do not list risks you are already handling unless they need to know.
- Asks must be specific: "Decision on X by Friday" not "support needed."

### Engineering Team Update

Engineers want: clear priorities, technical context, blockers resolved, decisions that affect their work.

**Format**:

```
Shipped:
- [Feature/fix] — [Link to PR/ticket]. [Impact if notable].

In progress:
- [Item] — [Owner]. [Expected completion]. [Blockers if any].

Decisions:
- [Decision made]: [Rationale]. [Link to ADR if exists].
- [Decision needed]: [Context]. [Options]. [Recommendation].

Priority changes:
- [What changed and why]

Coming up:
- [Next items] — [Context on why these are next]
```

**Tips for engineering updates**:

- Link to specific tickets, PRs, and documents. Engineers want to click through for details.
- When priorities change, explain why. Engineers are more bought in when they understand the reason.
- Be explicit about what is blocking them and what you are doing to unblock it.
- Do not waste their time with information that does not affect their work.

### Cross-Functional Partner Update

Partners (design, marketing, sales, support) want: what is coming that affects them, what they need to prepare for, how to give input.

**Format**:

```
What's coming:
- [Feature/launch] — [Date]. [What this means for your team].

What we need from you:
- [Specific ask] — [Context]. By [date].

Decisions made:
- [Decision] — [How it affects your team].

Open for input:
- [Topic we'd love feedback on] — [How to provide it].
```

### Customer / External Update

Customers want: what is new, what is coming, how it benefits them, how to get started.

**Format**:

```
What's new:
- [Feature] — [Benefit in customer terms]. [How to use it / link].

Coming soon:
- [Feature] — [Expected timing]. [Why it matters to you].

Known issues:
- [Issue] — [Workaround/status].
```
