# Content Creation Skill

Guidelines and frameworks for creating effective marketing content across channels.

## Content Type Templates

### Blog Post Structure

1.  **Headline** — clear, benefit-driven, includes primary keyword (aim for 60 characters or less for SEO)
2.  **Introduction** (100-150 words) — hook the reader with a question, statistic, bold claim, or relatable scenario.
3.  **Body sections** (3-5 sections) — each with a descriptive subheading (H2). Use H3 for subsections.
4.  **Conclusion** (75-100 words) — summarize key takeaways, reinforce the main message, include a call to action.
5.  **Meta description** — under 160 characters, includes primary keyword, compels the click.

### Social Media Post Structure

- **Hook** — first line grabs attention (question, bold statement, number)
- **Body** — 2-4 concise points or a short narrative
- **CTA** — what should the reader do next (comment, click, share, tag)
- **Hashtags** — 3-5 relevant hashtags (platform-dependent)

### Email Newsletter Structure

- **Subject line** — under 50 characters, creates curiosity or states clear value
- **Preview text** — complements the subject line
- **Body sections** — 2-3 content blocks, each scannable
- **Primary CTA** — one clear action per email
- **Footer** — unsubscribe link, company info, social links

### Landing Page Structure

- **Headline** — primary benefit in under 10 words
- **Subheadline** — elaborates on the headline with supporting context
- **Hero section** — headline, subheadline, primary CTA, supporting image or video
- **Value propositions** — 3-4 benefit-driven sections with icons or images
- **Social proof** — testimonials, logos, stats, case study snippets
- **Final CTA** — repeat the primary call to action

### Case Study Structure

- **Title** — "[Customer] achieves [result] with [product]"
- **Snapshot** — customer name, industry, key result
- **Challenge** — what problem the customer faced
- **Solution** — what was implemented and how
- **Results** — quantified outcomes with specific metrics
- **CTA** — learn more, get a demo, read more case studies

## Writing Best Practices by Channel

### Blog

- Write at an 8th-grade reading level for broad audiences
- Use short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Include subheadings every 200-300 words
- Use bullet points and numbered lists to break up text
- Write in active voice

### Social Media

- **LinkedIn**: professional but human, paragraph breaks for readability
- **Twitter/X**: concise and punchy, strong opening words
- **Instagram**: visual-first captions, storytelling hooks
- **Facebook**: conversational tone, questions drive engagement

### Email

- Subject lines that create urgency, curiosity, or state clear value
- Personalize where possible (name, company)
- One primary CTA per email — make it visually distinct
- Keep body copy scannable: bold key phrases, short paragraphs
- Mobile-first: most email is read on mobile

### Web (Landing Pages, Product Pages)

- Lead with benefits, not features
- Use "you" language — speak to the reader directly
- Every section should answer "so what?" from the reader's perspective
- Reduce friction: fewer form fields, clear next steps

## SEO Fundamentals for Content

### Keyword Strategy

- Identify one primary keyword and 2-3 secondary keywords per piece
- Use the primary keyword in: headline, first paragraph, one subheading, meta description, URL slug
- Do not keyword-stuff — write for humans first

### On-Page SEO Checklist

- **Title tag**: under 60 characters, includes primary keyword
- **Meta description**: under 160 characters, includes primary keyword
- **URL slug**: short, descriptive, includes primary keyword
- **H1**: one per page, matches or reflects the title tag
- **Internal links**: 2-3 links to related content on your site
- **External links**: 1-2 links to authoritative sources

## Headline and Hook Formulas

### Headline Formulas

- **How to [achieve result] [without common obstacle]**
- **[Number] [adjective] ways to [achieve result]**
- **Why [common belief] is wrong (and what to do instead)**
- **The [adjective] guide to [topic]**
- **What [impressive result] taught us about [topic]**

### Hook Formulas (Opening Lines)

- **Surprising statistic**: "73% of marketers say their biggest challenge is..."
- **Contrarian statement**: "The best marketing campaigns start with saying no..."
- **Question**: "When was the last time a marketing email actually changed what you bought?"
- **Scenario**: "Imagine launching a campaign and knowing, before it goes live..."

## Call-to-Action Best Practices

### CTA Principles

- Use action verbs: "Get", "Start", "Download", "Join", "Try", "See"
- Be specific about what happens next: "Start your free trial"
- Create urgency when genuine: "Limited spots available"
- Reduce risk: "No credit card required", "Cancel anytime"
- One primary CTA per page or email

### CTA Placement

- Above the fold on landing pages
- After establishing value in emails
- At the end of blog posts
- Repeat the primary CTA at the bottom of long-form pages
