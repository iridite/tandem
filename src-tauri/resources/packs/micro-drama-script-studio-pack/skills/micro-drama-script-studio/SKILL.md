# Micro-Drama Script Studio Skill

## Mission

Turn the pack inputs into a publishable short episode package with strong continuity and clear production handoff.

## Inputs To Use First

- inputs/SCRIPT_FORMAT.md
- inputs/STYLE_GUIDE.md
- inputs/CHARACTER_SHEETS.md
- inputs/LOCATIONS.md
- inputs/EXAMPLE_EPISODES/

## Workflow

1. Extract constraints: tone, runtime target, scene count, line length, and format rules.
2. Build an episode concept: premise, emotional arc, cliffhanger, and hook line.
3. Draft beats in sequence: open, escalation, reveal, turn, close.
4. Write final script in required format and keep character voice consistent.
5. Produce support artifacts in outputs/ for quick review.

## Required Outputs

- outputs/episode_script.md
- outputs/episode_beats.md
- outputs/cast_sheet.md
- outputs/writers_room_dashboard.html

## Quality Bar

- Every scene advances conflict or payoff.
- Dialogue is character-specific and concise.
- Episode ending creates forward momentum.
- Formatting is consistent with SCRIPT_FORMAT.md.
