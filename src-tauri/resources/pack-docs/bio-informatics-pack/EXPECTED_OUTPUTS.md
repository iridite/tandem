## Files

- `outputs/environment_checklist.md`: environment/tooling readiness and versions.

- `outputs/analysis_findings.md`: concise interpretation and confidence caveats.
- `outputs/bioinformatics_report.html`: stakeholder-ready summary page.

## Quality Criteria

- **Reproducibility**: commands, config references, and assumptions are explicit.
- **Traceability**: each conclusion links back to a run step or artifact.
- **Risk visibility**: failures, missing dependencies, and data caveats are documented.
- **Clarity**: final report is understandable for both technical and non-technical readers.
